<p>Emails released by the US Department of Justice earlier this month appear to show the former duke sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore.</p>
<p>One email, dated November 2010, was forwarded by Andrew just five minutes after being sent by his then-special advisor, Amir Patel.</p>
<figure id="0_4pamibf9" data-urn="urn:pressassociation:video:202402">
</figure><p>The former duke made the visits in his capacity as trade envoy in late 2010, conducting meetings and trade talks.</p>

<p>Additionally, on Christmas Eve 2010, Andrew looped Epstein in on a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said he had reported the allegations to police.</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: “I have now reported Andrew to the (Thames Valley Police) for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets in relation to these specific allegations.</p>

<p>“I cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson.”</p>
<p>Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links but has not directly responded to the latest allegations.</p>

<p>On Monday, Thames Valley Police confirmed they were assessing the fresh allegations.</p>
<p>A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm receipt of this report and are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.”</p>
<p>Mr Smith told the Press Association he received a confirmation email after making the report.</p>
<p>It comes after the force last week said it was assessing allegations that a woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew in 2010.</p>
