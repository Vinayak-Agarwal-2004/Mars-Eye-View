The Congress party's actions, including the burning of effigies, indicate significant dissatisfaction with the municipal leadership, often tying these issues to broader political narratives against the ruling BJP. This unrest occurs simultaneously with police efforts to bolster public safety and restore order, suggesting a complex interplay of civic concerns and state responses.",
