According to the lawsuit, dozens of BORTAC, ICE, and DEA agents burst into their Arizona home shortly before 5 am on November 4, 2009. Six children were present along with Guerrero, her three sisters, and her 60-year-old mother, who was thrown to the ground at gunpoint and cursed out by BORTAC members, the suit claimed. Carmina asked to put clothes on and was allegedly told, “You fucking whore, you don’t deserve any respect.”</p><p class="paywall">According to the complaint, the family was taken outside half-clothed, photographed, and held at gunpoint in 37 degree weather while the house was searched. Another federal agent later told the photographer to erase the photos, according to the complaint. Two of the adult women in the Guerrero family claim they were physically assaulted and subjected to degrading sexual remarks by the Border Patrol agents. No contraband was found during the raid. No arrests were made. The house was torn apart. A warrant was finally presented at 1:30 pm that afternoon.</p></div></div></body></html>
