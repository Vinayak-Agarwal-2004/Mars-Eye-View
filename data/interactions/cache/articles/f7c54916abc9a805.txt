        <p>  KHARTOUM, Feb 10, 2026 (BSS/AFP) - More than 100,000 people have fled <br>
Sudan's embattled Kordofan since October, the United Nations said on Tuesday, <br>
as fighting escalates across the vast southern region.</p>

<p>Since April 2023, Sudan has been engulfed in a brutal war between the <br>
Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).</p>

<p>The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced over 11 <br>
million and triggered what the UN describes as one of the world's worst <br>
humanitarian crises.</p>

<p>Data from the UN's International Organization for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday <br>
showed that an estimated 115,223 people were displaced from Kordofan between <br>
October 25 and February 5.</p>

<p>The surge followed more than 80 violent incidents recorded across North, <br>
South and West Kordofan states, the UN agency said.</p>

<p>The exodus from the southern region came after the RSF shifted its focus <br>
there, following its takeover of El-Fasher -- the Sudanese army's last <br>
stronghold in the neighbouring Darfur region -- in October.</p>

<p>The capture of El-Fasher, which forced at least 127,000 people to flee, was <br>
accompanied by reports of mass killings, rape, abductions and widespread <br>
looting.</p>

<p>The UN has repeatedly warned that similar atrocities could unfold in <br>
Kordofan, which has now emerged as a key battleground in the wider war.</p>

<p>UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Monday that nearly 100 civilians <br>
were killed and 142 injured in drone strikes in Kordofan in the two weeks <br>
leading up to February 6.</p>

<p>He said strikes by both warring parties hit targets including a World Food <br>
Programme convoy, markets, health facilities and residential areas across <br>
North and South Kordofan.</p>

<p>Kordofan is strategically located between RSF-controlled Darfur to the west <br>
and the army-held Nile Valley to the east, north and centre -- a position <br>
that has left it increasingly exposed as both sides vie for control.</p>        </div>
