<p>Re: “<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/30/rtd-governance-state-lawmakers-accountability-transit/">RTD: Panel suggests smaller board</a>,” Jan. 30 news story</p>
<p>With or without changes in the RTD Board’s make-up, at some point the Board must tackle the elephant in the room: the loss of ridership due to a lack of consistent connectivity for passengers between train-to-bus, and bus-to-bus routes, so transfer “wait” times become less than two minutes.</p>
<p>One glaring problem is found in Olde Town Arvada, where connecting from the light rail to departing bus service in a timely manner is impossible. The bus depot is two stories beneath the train platform and several blocks from the closest stairway.</p>
<p>Whatever form the RTD board takes in the future, I strongly urge its members to spend a week in Montreal or Toronto.  For several days they should depend solely on mass transit to find their way to various places around the metro areas. Board members will experience an efficient mass transit system (much larger than Denver’s) that will take them from point A to point B, C, all the way to Z, with minimal “wait” times at transfer stops.</p><p class="s2nPlayer k-smyizmlx" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_smyizmlx"></p>

<p>There must be a way to have a smooth-running mass transit system here, at least from morning rush hour into the evening. That is how you increase dependability, ridership, and loyalty, no matter how many people serve on the RTD board. And building a train stop for Coors Field shouldn’t be that difficult either. The track is already there.</p>

<h4>Former state senator should face real consequences for her felonies</h4>
<p>Re: “<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/28/sonya-jaquez-lewis-guilty-verdict-felony-charges/">Jury finds ex-Longmont state senator guilty of four felonies</a>,” Jan. 29 news story</p>
<p>A recent story about the trial of former state Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis indicated the prosecutor would recommend probation for her felony convictions. If that is true, that would be a terrible thing to do. She was convicted of misusing her power and violating the trust given to her as a public official. Elected officials should be held to higher standards than most people.</p>				
<p>In these times where public trust in institutions is breaking down, this is exactly the wrong message. She should serve the maximum possible sentence in jail — in a state medium-security jail, not a plush adult day care center.</p>
<p>If she receives only probation, that will further inflame mistrust of government and lead only to more cynicism. I can’t help looking at it as her being handed a “get out of jail free” card because she is a loyal member of the Democratic organization.</p>

<h4>Musicians’ messaging provides hope</h4>
<p>Re: “Iran: Supreme leader warns any U.S. attack would spark ‘regional war’,” and “Bad Bunny wins album of the year; Eilish wins song of year Grammy Awards,” Feb. 2 news stories</p>				
<p>Our old President Trump and Iran’s old Supreme Leader exchanged threats. And then Billie Eilish said, “No one is illegal on stolen land.” And then Bad Bunny said, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.”</p>

<p>Music and musicians give me hope.</p>

<h4>Enough of the pleasant weather already</h4>
<p>I’ve endured over 80 years of snow and blistery winters – including a Thanksgiving storm back in the 1980s that left 40 inches of snow at the house here — but never one like this.</p>
<p>I’m not complaining, mind you — it’s gratifying to make our frequent doctor and follow-up appointments on dry streets. But it’s weird. I have to experience winter vicariously by reading about all the heroic folks back east persevering while a battalion of snow-removal vehicles sit idle here.</p>
<p>Our ski areas are beginning to call this a “lost” year as their snow totals are half the usual amount. We may experience water rationing come summer if they don’t return our winters to us soon.</p>

<h4>Trump’s retribution against Colorado hurts many of his voters</h4>
<p>Trump and his administration’s retribution efforts against Colorado are going to hurt many of the 43% of voters in Colorado that cast their 2024 ballots for him.</p>
<p>FEMA assistance from fires and flooding in and near Pagosa? Denied, a red area. Moving Space Command away from Colorado Springs? A red area. Vetoing a bipartisan bill that would provide fresh drinking water to the lower Arkansas Valley? A red area. Trying to shut down NCAR? True enough, it is in Boulder County, but hundreds of jobs will be lost if that decision (which legally is solely Congress’ decision) stands and that will have ramifications beyond NCAR that will impact all voters.  I truly wish all politicians would realize that they were chosen to represent their entire electorate, not just their voters, and act accordingly.  Democracy works best when it works for the good for as many as possible.</p>

<h4>Expand access to physical therapy for older Americans</h4>
<p>If you have older loved ones in your life, it’s likely that one of them has experienced a fall. As the leading cause of injury and injury-related death in individuals over 65, falls can be devasting physically, emotionally, and financially for patients. Yet many falls could be avoided with the right preventative care: physical therapy.</p>
<p>As we age, physical therapy can be an important tool to keeping us strong, healthy, and mobile. As fall experts, physical therapists have specialized knowledge in assessing patients and tailoring treatment plans to prevent falls. That’s why it’s crucial that older Coloradans have access to this life-saving care.</p>
<p>One way to improve access is through the bipartisan Stopping Addiction and Falls for the Elderly (SAFE) Act (H.R. 1171), which would enable Medicare beneficiaries to receive a no-cost falls risk assessment by a physical or occupational therapist as part of their annual wellness visit.</p>
<p>I’m thankful to Representative Gabe Evans for recently sending staff to North Boulder Physical Therapy to discuss the value of physical therapy care and the importance of passing the SAFE Act to help prevent falls and reduce healthcare spending. I now encourage Rep. Evans to cosponsor this commonsense legislative solution.</p>
<p>By preventing falls, we can help more older Americans thrive and live their lives to the fullest.</p>

<h4>DIA makes simple move to help large percentage of travelers</h4>
<p>Recently traveling through DIA Denver International Airport I had reason to use the women’s toilets on the C concourse. I was surprised and delighted to discover that inside the stalls there was a dispenser of sanitary pads.</p>
<p>This is something I had never seen before and worked like a roll of toilet paper.</p>
<p>Since 50% of the population has need of this product at various times in their life it made so much sense to make it available to travelers in the space where it is useful.</p>
<p>My kudos to the management of the airport for thinking of the most efficient delivery system of period products to their customers. While I’m quite sure it also streamlines costs and improves the maintenance of the facility, the peace of mind of the female travelers are reaping the greatest benefits of all. Thank you DIA. My tax dollars at work in a way that makes me proud to be from Denver.</p>
