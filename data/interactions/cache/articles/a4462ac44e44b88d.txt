                                <p>Venezuelan Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado said Monday that armed government agents had "kidnapped" a close ally — hours after he was released from prison and demanded democratic elections.</p><p>Machado said a group of heavily armed men in civilian clothes seized Juan Pablo Guanipa, 61, in the Los Chorros district of Caracas.</p><p>The former National Assembly vice president had walked out of jail Sunday as part of a slow-moving wave of releases of political prisoners.</p><p id="rc-widget-4ce4fe" data-rc-widget data-widget-host="habitat" data-endpoint="//trends.revcontent.com" data-widget-id="268430" class="block"></p><p>The Public Prosecutor's Office later confirmed Guanipa had been detained for violating the terms of his release and would be placed under house arrest, without providing more details. </p><p>"They haven't told us where my father is or where he will be transferred," his son Ramon Guanipa said.</p><p>"I demand proof of life for my father immediately. He didn't violate any of the conditions of his release, and we don't know where he is."</p><p>Guanipa's arrest sent a chilling message to those pushing for democratic reforms, and for Machado, who is pondering a return to her homeland from exile in the United States.</p><p>"We demand his immediate release," Machado said, alleging that his detention undermined promises to end decades of repression and one-party rule, but still asserting her determination to return to Venezuela.</p><p>"This does not affect my return in the slightest. Quite the opposite," she insisted. </p><p>During a few hours of freedom, Guanipa met relatives of political detainees and challenged authorities to respect the results of a 2024 election.</p><p>The opposition is widely believed to have won that vote, but then-president Nicolas Maduro claimed victory and remained in power.</p><p>"You don't want to respect it? Then let's go to a (new) electoral process," Guanipa told AFP. </p><h2>- Winds of change? -</h2><p>Guanipa was first arrested in May 2025 on charges of "terrorism", money laundering and inciting violence, accusations rights groups say were widely used to silence critics under the Maduro administration.</p><p>His renewed detention came on the eve of a landmark vote in Venezuela's National Assembly that would grant amnesty to political dissidents and others.</p><p>Maduro was captured in a US special forces raid in Caracas on January 3, and spirited to the United States where he now faces trial.</p><p>His replacement, former vice president Delcy Rodriguez, has tentatively cooperated with the United States: promising a slice of Venezuela's vast oil reserves and a major political opening.</p><p>Rights group Foro Penal said there have been nearly 400 prisoner releases since Rodriguez took charge, including 35 on Sunday.</p><p>But reforms have been slow, and much of the military-backed government remains unchanged.</p><p>Rights groups estimate that around 700 people are still waiting to be freed. </p><p>US Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar — a close ally of Secretary of State Marco Rubio — warned that Guanipa should be released immediately.</p><p>"If anything happens to him, there will be very grave consequences. The United States is watching," she posted in Spanish.</p><p>Political prisoner Albany Colmenares was among those released to jubilant scenes on Sunday. </p><p>Flag-waving family and friends cried "freedom" and rushed to hug her as she emerged from Tocuyito prison, three hours' drive west of Caracas.</p><p>"Many good things are coming for our country; we will continue to work very hard for that, and we ask you to continue accompanying us," she said.</p><p>bur-arb/msp</p><p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"></p>
