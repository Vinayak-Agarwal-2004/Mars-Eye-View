<p>Last week, the British newspaper The Guardian reported that Israeli forces had “bulldozed” part of the cemetery in al-Tuffah last year.</p>
<p>The newspaper said satellite photos show “no visible trace left” of a plot set aside for Canadian UN peacekeepers, and quoted the graveyard’s former caretaker, Essam Jaradah, saying he witnessed the bulldozing.</p><div class="newsletter-prompt business-weekly" data-newsletter-position="newsletter-prompt">

<p>The Israel Defense Forces told the newspaper it took “operational measures” to “neutralize identified threats” in a combat zone and that underground infrastructure “within the cemetery” and in structures nearby was being used as cover.</p>
<p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 9, 2028.</p><p class="collageplus"></p>
