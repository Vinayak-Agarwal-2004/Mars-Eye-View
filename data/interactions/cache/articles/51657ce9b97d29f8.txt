The sentence was made up of 16-and-a-half years for fraud and perverting the course of justice, and 18 months for possession of child abuse images, which came to light after police raided his home.</p><p class="mol-para-with-font">Under the sentencing policy of the previous Conservative government he was previously due for release on October 1, 2027.
