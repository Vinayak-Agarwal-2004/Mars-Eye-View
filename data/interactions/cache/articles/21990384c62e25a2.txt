The officers repeatedly instructed him to drop the weapon and attempted to isolate him in the home’s living room by closing a glass door between them and Chakraborty.

The family said Chakraborty was shot at least four times.</p><p>"We called for help," the family said. "We called 911 for an ambulance to provide medical attention for our son, who was in emotional distress. We did not call the police.

It is important for us to have all of the options available," he added.</p><p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/washington-man-allegedly-lures-police-bogus-911-call-slashes-officer-face" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WASHINGTON MAN ALLEGEDLY LURES POLICE WITH BOGUS 911 CALL, SLASHES OFFICER IN FACE</strong></a></p><div class="image-ct inline"> <div class="info"><div class="caption"><p><span>The officers repeatedly told the man to drop the weapon as they attempted to de-escalate the situation before one officer fired several times.</span> <span>(Susan Watts/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)</span></p></div></div></div><p><a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p><p>The mayor also said he had met with Chakraborty's family, who had criticized him for his initial response to the shooting. Mamdani said hours after the shooting that police had "encountered an individual wielding a knife," and that he was "grateful to the first responders who put themselves on the line each day to keep our communities safe."</p><p>"After all this, we saw Mayor Mamdani’s statement applauding the NYPD officers that shot our son, threatened and lied to us, and kept us from seeing our son for over 24 hours," the family's statement read. "Why is the mayor applauding officers who recklessly almost killed our son in front of us?"</p>  <p class="article-meta"></p></div> </div></body></html>
