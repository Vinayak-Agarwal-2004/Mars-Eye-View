<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge who <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/03/us-news/dhs-slams-judge-for-blocking-trump-admins-efforts-to-end-deportation-protections-for-haitian-migrants/">blocked the Trump administration from deporting 350,000 Haitians</a> has donated more than $38,000 to Democratic campaigns — including the main committee for the former president who appointed her and let those migrants in: Joe Biden.</p>



<p>The order revoking temporary protected status for the Haitian migrants from DC US District Judge Ana C. Reyes outraged administration officials and Republicans like Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio), who <a href="https://x.com/berniemoreno/status/2018511665134997590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted on X</a> that “an unelected Democrat judge” had “unilaterally” halted President Trump’s deportations.</p>



<p>Biden appointed Reyes to the federal bench in February 2023 — one month after his administration allowed <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/02/us-news/biden-admin-halts-migrant-flights-from-cuba-haiti-nicaragua-and-venezuela-report/">up to 30,000 Haitians to enter the US every month</a> under a humanitarian parole program.</p>

<p>Others entered through the southern border — including several apprehended by Border Patrol agents in Texas. The Biden administration <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/07/08/border-agents-falsely-accused-of-whipping-migrants-punishment/">falsely accused agents of whipping those migrants</a>.</p>

<p>The Uruguay-born jurist had previously served as a litigation attorney focused on international disputes at Williams &amp; Connolly LLP, while working pro bono on behalf of refugee groups. She emigrated with her family to Kentucky when she was a child.</p>


	



<p>Reyes’ federal election contributions, which were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-who-blocked-key-trump-executive-order-has-long-history-left-wing-activism-dem-donations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously exposed by Fox News</a>, show that while at the law firm she has apparently donated exclusively to Democratic campaigns since 2008.</p>



<p>She maxed out donations to Biden for President with two $2,800 contributions in August 2020 — and shelled out $2,700 to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s campaign against Donald Trump in 2016.</p>



<p>Then-California Sen. Kamala Harris’ campaign also received $4,500 from Reyes during her failed run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019.</p>

<p>Reyes gave $200 to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for Congress in 2019, one year after her first successful run for Congress. The Bronx and Queens Democrat has supported the “Abolish ICE” movement and even hawked “<a href="https://shop.ocasiocortez.com/products/abolish-ice-dad-hat?_pos=1&amp;_sid=9fb407784&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dad Hats</a>” bearing the slogan.</p>



<p>Moreno balked at Reyes’ recent order as amounting to an admission of “Permanent Protected Status” for all migrants let in from Haiti.</p>

<p>“When a Democrat president can create a TEMPORARY program and an unelected Democrat judge can unilaterally block a duly-elected Republican president from ever undoing it, we do not live in a democracy,” Moreno said. “This outrageous decision cannot stand.”</p>



<p>Separate cases that saw judges similarly block the Trump administration’s attempts to rescind protections for migrants from Venezuela and <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/us-news/trump-administration-can-terminate-temporary-protected-status-for-more-than-60000-migrants-appeals-court-rules/">Nicaragua</a> were struck down by appeals courts and the <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/03/us-news/supreme-court-allows-trump-admin-to-strip-deportation-protections-from-300k-venezuelan-migrants/">US Supreme Court</a>.</p>

<p>Reyes ruled Monday that Homeland Security Secretary <a href="https://nypost.com/2026/02/02/us-news/dhs-chief-kristi-noem-oks-body-cameras-for-feds-in-minneapolis-as-dems-push-for-more-reforms/">Kristi Noem</a> did not have authority to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian migrants, which gave them work authorizations to remain in the US.</p>



<p>“Supreme Court, here we come,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/2018502877321334812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired back on X</a>. “Haiti’s TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades.”</p>

<p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/10/03/us-news/supreme-court-allows-trump-admin-to-strip-deportation-protections-from-300k-venezuelan-migrants/">TPS program</a> has provided humanitarian relief, work permits and temporary legal status to migrants from disaster-plagued and war-ravaged regions since the 1990s. The Obama administration added Haitians to the program after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake that hit the island nation in 2010.</p>




<p>Reyes’ order stated it was “substantially likely” that Noem sought to terminate the program “because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants.” </p>



<p>“Secretary Noem has terminated every TPS country designation to have reached her desk — twelve countries up, twelve countries down,” the judge wrote.</p>



<p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?">
</p>



<p>“Her conclusion that Haiti (a majority nonwhite country) faces merely ‘concerning’ conditions cannot be squared with the ‘perfect storm of suffering’ and ‘staggering’ ‘humanitarian toll’ described in page-after-page of the Certified Administrative Record (CAR).” </p>
