Reports indicate they were tortured before being executed by hanging on April 8, 1980.</p><p>The execution sparked widespread outrage at the time and remains a symbol of repression under Saddam Hussein's rule. Hussein was from Iraq's Sunni minority.</p><p>Since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, authorities have pursued former officials accused of crimes against humanity and abuses against political and religious opponents. Iraq has faced criticism from human rights groups over its application of the death penalty.</p></div><p class="articleblock-container" id="arthardpv"></p><div class="update-publish-time article-published-time-end"><p class="publish-time-new"> Published <span>- February 09, 2026 04:43 pm IST</span></p></div><p class="spliter pt-0 mb-0 print-hide"></p><p class="d-none d-lg-block d-xl-block"></p><p class="d-block d-sm-none "></p></div></div></body></html>
