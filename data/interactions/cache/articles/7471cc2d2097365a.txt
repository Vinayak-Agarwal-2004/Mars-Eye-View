             Cameroonian separatist leader Lucas Cho Ayaba, detained in Norway for allegedly inciting crimes against humanity, is now also suspected of war crimes, police and his lawyer said Monday.
</p>
<p>
            Francophone-majority Cameroon has been gripped since 2016 by a bloody conflict in its two anglophone regions, in the northwest and southwest, between separatists and state forces.
</p>
<p>
            At least 6,000 civilians have been killed since the conflict began, according to Human Rights Watch.
</p>
<p>
            Lucas Cho Ayaba, also know as Cho Lucas Yabah, was arrested in September 2024 and has been detained since then with Norwegian authorities arguing he was a flight risk.
</p>
<p>
            The Kripos police unit that deals with war crimes and crimes against humanity, said a man in his fifties, who had been in detention since September 2024 on suspicion of incitement to commit crimes against humanity, was now suspected of additional crimes.
</p>
<p>
            "The new indictment concerns... war crimes," a statement said, adding that the suspect was believed to have a "central role in an ongoing armed conflict in Cameroon."
</p>
<p>
            It said the new suspicions included attempted murder and deprivation of liberty.
</p>
<p>
            "Norway has an international responsibility to ensure that we are not a safe haven for individuals who commit war crimes and crimes against humanity," police prosecutor Anette Berger said.
</p>
<p>
            Berger noted that the case was the first of its kind in Norway.
</p>
<p>
            Ayaba's lawyer, Morten Engesbak, confirmed to AFP that the suspect in question was his client.
</p>
<p>
            "He rejects the charges of incitement to crimes against humanity and incitement to war crimes," Engesbak said.
</p>
<p>
            Police also requested that his detention be extended for another eight weeks.
</p>
<p>
            The conflict in Cameroon erupted after President Paul Biya, who has ruled for more than four decades, violently suppressed peaceful protests by English speakers, many of whom feel marginalised.
</p>
<p>
            The anglophone community comprises about 20 percent of the population.
</p>
<p>
            Ayaba is the leader of the Ambazonia Defence Forces, one of the main armed groups operating in the anglophone areas.
</p>
<p>
            Armed groups fighting for an independent anglophone Cameroon have frequently kidnapped or killed politicians, civil servants and teachers accused of collaborating with the government.
</p>
<p>
            In turn, the army and police are accused of carrying out punishing raids on people accused of being separatist sympathisers.</p>
