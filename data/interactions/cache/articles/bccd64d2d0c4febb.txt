<p>What began as a typical Wednesday evening near a <a href="https://www.theroot.com/houston-family-dollar-employee-talks-trash-about-black-1851771595">Houston</a> apartment complex spiraled into a chaotic brawl involving up to 30 people and a 13-year-old girl’s life cut short. Now, Harris County prosecutors must decide whether a 10-year-old boy, barely out of elementary school, should face a rare legal path that could see him behind bars until his 19th birthday and beyond.</p>

<p>The Houston Police Department said there was a 20-30 person fight between two groups of people at an apartment complex near the intersection of Grow Lane and Dow Road on the city’s northwest side, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/apartment-stabbing-victim-balloon-release/285-3e078136-8634-44b0-879e-ef61107524ce">according to KHOU 11</a>. </p><p class="therootads-cc4318a24e9abe37c5a438de538811d4 therootads-mobile-in_post-repeating" id="therootads-cc4318a24e9abe37c5a438de538811d4"></p>



<p>Officials are investigating whether the fight stemmed from an earlier dispute involving several teenagers at a Cy-Fair ISD school. Houston Police Lt. Larry Crowson said the incidents appear to be related, local news channel <a href="https://abc13.com/post/13-year-old-girl-killed-stabbing-northwest-houston-10-boy-detained-hpd-says/18544829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KTRK 13</a> reported.</p><p id="eb1e22300ec841bf91d7776867621e4f"></p>
        



<p>Officers responded to calls of a stabbing and disturbance around 8 p.m. Upon their arrival, they found Riley DeArmas, 13, “suffering from a stab wound.” The Houston Fire Department paramedics transported her to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced deceased.</p>



<p>Lt. Crowson said during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I24ff2sko_I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press conference</a> after Wednesday’s slaying that DeArmas was among the crowd who “came over and started assaulting people in that apartment.” </p><p class="therootads-e0d208ed47cd6d07ed92478995e08914 therootads-mobile-in_post-repeating" id="therootads-e0d208ed47cd6d07ed92478995e08914"></p>



<p>Police detained the 10-year-old boy at the scene but later released him pending further investigation. <a href="https://www.tdcaa.com/journal/the-basics-of-juvenile-law/#:~:text=In%20Texas%2C%20a%20person%20can,in%20the%20upcoming%20legislative%20session.)">Under Texas law</a>, 10 is the minimum age of criminal responsibility, leaving prosecutors to determine if the boy will face charges in juvenile court. A child must be at least 14 years old to stand trial in adult criminal court for a first-degree felony like murder.</p>



<p>Investigators said the boy surrendered to police and reportedly admitted to stabbing DeArmas, but claimed he acted in self-defense, according to KTRK 13. The girl’s mother, Ashley DeArmas, said that wasn’t the case.</p>



<p>“There was no self-defense. My daughter was attacked,” Ashley said, adding her late daughter “was not a violent person. She would never harm anyone intentionally.”</p><p class="therootads-2217b97d203f99d12b3db236879b8b71 therootads-mobile-in_post-repeating" id="therootads-2217b97d203f99d12b3db236879b8b71"></p>



<p>Riley— whom her mother described as “joyful,” “free-spirited” and “happy”— would’ve turned 14 years old next month. “I will never get a chance to hug her, to tell her I love her, because her life was just cut so short,” Ashley added. Officials said they are speaking with additional witnesses and reviewing surveillance videos. </p>



<p>Criminal defense attorney Joe Vinas, who is not connected to the case, <a href="https://abc13.com/post/13-year-old-girl-killed-stabbing-northwest-houston-10-boy-detained-hpd-says/18544829/">said</a> per Texas law, “You actually don’t even have to be right, you don’t have to be correct to assert a self-defense, as long as a reasonable person in the actor’s position could be in fear of imminent serious bodily injury or death, they could then use deadly force to defend themselves.”</p>
