<p>Emails released by the US Department of Justice earlier this month appear to show the former duke sharing reports of official visits to Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Singapore.</p>
<p>One email, dated November 2010, was forwarded by Andrew just five minutes after being sent by his then-special advisor, Amir Patel.</p>

<p>Additionally, on Christmas Eve 2010, Andrew looped Epstein in on a confidential brief on investment opportunities in the reconstruction of Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Graham Smith, chief executive of anti-monarchy campaign group Republic, said he had reported the allegations to police.</p>
<p>In a post on X, he said: “I have now reported Andrew to the (Thames Valley Police) for suspected misconduct in public office and breach of official secrets in relation to these specific allegations.</p>

<p>“I cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson.”</p>
<p>Andrew has previously denied any wrongdoing over his Epstein links but has not directly responded to the latest allegations.</p>

<p>On Monday, Thames Valley Police confirmed they were assessing the fresh allegations.</p>
<p>A Thames Valley Police spokesperson said: “We can confirm receipt of this report and are assessing the information in line with our established procedures.”</p>
<p>Mr Smith told the Press Association he received a confirmation email after making the report.</p>
<p>It comes after the force last week said it was assessing allegations that a woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with Andrew in 2010.</p>

<p>The messages regarding official visits are dated after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution.</p>
<p>Andrew previously told BBC’s Newsnight in 2019 he had cut off contact with the convicted paedophile in December 2010 during a visit to New York.</p>
<p>On February 9 2011, Andrew told Epstein he had visited a private equity firm the week before and “thought of you” as the financier, who was reportedly “looking for somewhere for money to go”.</p>

<p>Official government guidance highlights that the role of a trade envoy carries a duty of confidentiality regarding sensitive information.</p>
<p>“This may include sensitive, commercial, or political information shared about relevant markets/visits,” guidance from the Department of Business and Trade reads.</p>
<p>“This duty of confidentiality will continue to apply after the expiry of their term of office. In addition, the Official Secrets Acts 1911 and 1989 will apply.”</p>

<p>Andrew features a number of times in the latest document dump, including in images apparently showing him crouch over an unidentified woman in what appears to be Epstein’s New York mansion.</p>
<p>In 2022, the former duke paid millions of pounds to Virginia Giuffre, his main accuser, despite claiming never to have met her.</p>

<p>The King later stripped his younger brother of his titles following the posthumous release of a book by Ms Giuffre, who alleges she was trafficked by Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, at the age of 17.</p>
<p>The Press Association understands that Andrew moved out of Royal Lodge in Windsor – which is served by Thames Valley Police – and relocated to Norfolk to a property on the King’s Sandringham estate earlier this month, reported by The Sun to be Wood Farm Cottage, where he will stay temporarily.</p>
<p>It is understood the former duke’s new home Marsh Farm is not yet fully ready, but he is expected to move in by the start of April.</p>
