    <p></p><p>A court in Makhachkala sentenced local resident Irina Gladchenko to a suspended sentence, recognizing her as a member of the "Union of Slavic Forces of Rus'"*.</p> 
<p>As reported by "<a href="https://www.kavkaz-uzel.eu/">Caucasian Knot</a>," five "USSR citizens"* organizations have been designated as extremist. These include Sergei Taraskin's "USSR"*, whose primary name is listed as the "Union of Slavic Forces of Rus'"*. Then there's the "Council of USSR Citizens"* of the Prikubansky District of Krasnodar. Then there's the "People's Council of Citizens of the RSFSR USSR of the Arkhangelsk Region"*. "The community of 'citizens of the USSR'*, centered in Novokuibyshevsk in the Samara region, is listed as an extremist organization under the main name 'Citizens of the USSR'*. And also the 'Supreme Council of the Tatar ASSR'*, Mikhail Akhmetyev, an expert at the SOVA Research Center, previously told the Caucasian Knot.</p>

<p>People who consider themselves citizens of the USSR are an informal community; they <a href="https://www.caucasianknot.com/articles/386530/">unite in various organizations</a>, human rights activist Alexander Verkhovsky told the Caucasian Knot on March 6. "These are different people who believe that the USSR continues to legally exist, while the Russian Federation, on the contrary, does not. They unite in different organizations. From time to time, these organizations even split into parts,” he explained. According to the human rights activist, several organizations of those who consider themselves citizens of the USSR have already been banned in Russia, but they do not always include the abbreviation USSR. Dagestani supporters of radical leftist movements have not been noted for anti-Semitic antics and actions similar to those organized by supporters of the USSR* in other regions of Russia, said an expert from the SOVA Research Center** and deputy editor-in-chief of the Chernovik publication, commenting on the case of Larisa Bochieva.</p>

<p>The FSB Directorate for Dagestan reported today on the results of the criminal prosecution of Makhachkala resident Irina Gladchenko for participation in an extremist organization. According to the prosecution, the woman joined the Union of Slavic Forces Rus*, whose activities are banned in Russia. </p> 
<p>"She took part in events held by its members, promoted an ideology of hatred toward Russian government bodies, and called for the refusal to fulfill civil obligations," RIA Dagestan quotes security forces as saying. </p> 
<p>During a search of Gladchenko's home, law enforcement officers seized propaganda leaflets and brochures, as well as "organizational and administrative documents of an extremist organization."</p> 
<p>Irina Gladchenko's case was heard by the Kirovsky District Court of Makhachkala. According to the case file on the court's website, hearings in the case took place from October 2024 to September 2025, when Gladchenko was sentenced. </p> 
<p>The court sentenced the Makhachkala resident to two years and six months of suspended imprisonment. According to the FSB, the Supreme Court will hear Gladchenko's appeal. Dagestan was not satisfied, leaving the sentence unchanged. The case file, however, indicates that following the review of Gladchenko's lawyer's appeal in December 2025, the sentence was amended, but the content of the amendments is not specified. </p> 
<p>Irina Gladchenko's details were added to the Rosfinmonitoring register of extremists and terrorists in October 2023, a year before the start of her trial. The woman was born in June 1961 in the Minsk region of Belarus, according to the entry.</p>
