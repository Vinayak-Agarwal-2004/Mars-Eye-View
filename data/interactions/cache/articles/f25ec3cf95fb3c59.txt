Like I had folded the seats down in the back of a Ford Probe, in like a hatchback, and my friend was driving. We were coming back from Toledo, back up to Detroit," he said. "It was like, late at night, and I had to work super early in the morning. So I go, 'Hey, I'm gonna sleep in the back. Are you good to drive?'” His friend said he was, but things quickly went downhill.</p><p></p><div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"><img alt="HOLLYWOOD, CA - MARCH 02:  Actors Dax Shepard (L) and Kristen Bell attend the Oscars held at Hollywood &amp; Highland Center on March 2, 2014 in Hollywood, California.

Instead of the calm sound of smooth pavement, “I just heard gravel hitting the side of the car,” he said. He looked up to find his friend slumped over in the front seat, the car on cruise control, going 85 miles per hour.</p><p>"It's just pine trees lining that interstate in Michigan. And I started to go ... to grab the wheel, and there was a moment I just knew it was too far gone. Like we had gone completely sideways. I laid back down and then ... we just launched in the air, and we started rolling right down the highway," Shepard shared.</p><p>The “When In Rome” actor, who shares two kids with wife Kristen Bell, was sure that car ride was going to be his last. "I'm like, 'We're gonna hit a tree, and that's gonna be that.’ And I definitely had this moment where I was like, 'Oh, wow, I'm gonna die in a second.' And the feeling was shockingly comforting. Like, that I remember,” he revealed.</p><p></p><div class="ImageEmbed_imageEmbed__5mYLo"><img alt='PASADENA, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 16: Dax Shepard of "Top Gear America" speaks during the Discovery MotorTrend segment of the 2020 Winter TCA Press Tour at The Langham Huntington, Pasadena on January 16, 2020 in Pasadena, California.
