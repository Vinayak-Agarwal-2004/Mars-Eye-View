<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The IRA has admitted planting the bomb that exploded in the Docklands area of London last night.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">One man was found dead by police sifting through the wreckage today and another person has been reported missing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Five of the 39 casualties – including three police officers – remain in hospital, one of them in a critical condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The bombing marks the end of a 17-month IRA ceasefire during which Irish, British and American leaders worked for a political solution to the troubles in Northern Ireland.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">They have all condemned the attacks.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The leader of the political wing of the IRA – Sinn Fein – Gerry Adams has spoken of the need to continue the peace process.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">British Prime Minister John Major said there was now “a dark shadow of doubt” where optimism had existed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">His statement continued: “The IRA once again callously threatens the desire for peace. They will not be allowed to prevail.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The half-tonne bomb was left in a small lorry about 80 yards from South Quay Station on the Docklands Light Railway, in the regenerated commercial district.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">It exploded at 1902 GMT after coded warnings were telephoned to Dublin and Belfast media 90 minutes earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">The IRA has said “regrettable injuries” could have been avoided if police had responded promptly to “clear and specific warnings”.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Sir Paul Condon said: “It would be unfair to describe this as a failure of security. It was a failure of humanity.”</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Firemen worked throughout the night to clear up the devastation as a six-storey building collapsed and surrounding office blocks had their windows blown out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Immediate damage is estimated at £85 million in a blast felt in Canary Wharf Tower – the tallest building in Europe – a quarter of a mile away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">A second explosion caused by a gas leak hampered rescue efforts and Heron Quay and Canary Wharf Tower were both evacuated over fears of a second device.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><strong><span class="s3">In context</span></strong></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">A second body was found during the clear up operation.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">James McArdle, a 29-year-old bricklayer from County Armagh was found guilty of conspiracy to cause explosions in June 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">He was jailed for 25 years.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Murder charges – for the deaths of the two men killed, newsagents Inam Bashir and John Jeffries – were dropped when the judge dismissed the jury because of concerns about press coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Eighteen months later the IRA agreed another ceasefire.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Peace was finally negotiated with the Good Friday Agreement – accepted by voters in Ireland and Northern Ireland – in May 1998.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s4">Under the terms of the agreement, James McArdle was released in July 2000.</span></p>
