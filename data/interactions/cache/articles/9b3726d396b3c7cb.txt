<html><body><div><div class="body-copy"><p>NORRISTOWN — On the day he was supposed to be sentenced for raping a 13-year-old girl who was in his company at an Upper Providence Township location, a Delaware County man who previously admitted to the act had a change of heart and told a judge he wants to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>
<p>The sentencing hearing for Barry Cunningham, 44, of the 1100 block of East 8th Street, Eddystone, abruptly came to a halt on Tuesday when he expressed to a Montgomery County judge that he now wants to fight the sexual assault charges.</p>
<p>Given Cunningham’s decision, defense lawyer George M. Griffith Jr., who was court-appointed to represent Cunningham and who negotiated a plea agreement on behalf of Cunningham, asked Senior Judge Thomas C. Branca for permission to withdraw as Cunningham’s lawyer. Griffith, without revealing any specific defense strategies, explained Cunningham wanted him to take a defense position that he could not “ethically adopt.”</p>
<p>“He wanted me to put forth a defense that was not logical; it just wasn’t going to pass the smell test, if you will. I have a duty to put forth viable claims of innocence and the ones that Mr. Cunningham would like me to put forth are quite frankly not there,” Griffith explained.</p><p class="s2nPlayer k-9h9ft8h0" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_9h9ft8h0"></p>

<p>“So, that’s why I indicated to the court that I could not ethically adopt his rationale,” Griffith explained.</p>
<p>Branca granted Griffith’s motion to withdraw as Cunningham’s lawyer.</p>

<p>Branca gave Cunningham 45 days to retain private counsel who could then file appropriate motions on Cunningham’s behalf.</p>
<p>“I got family help,” Cunningham told the judge, implying he will be able to come up with funds to hire a lawyer.</p>				
<p>If, after 45 days, Cunningham is unable to retain a lawyer, the judge said Cunningham will have 10 days to file a motion, while representing himself, to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>
<p>Cunningham made it clear his ultimate goal is to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Gabriella Eileen Glenning was prepared to go forward with the sentencing hearing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The Commonwealth has always been ready to go to trial in this case, so we will continue to be ready to go to trial if that is how the defendant seeks to take this case,” Glenning reacted after Cunningham announced his intention to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>

<p>Last August, Cunningham pleaded guilty to charges of rape and endangering the welfare of a child in connection with an alleged July 3, 2024, incident that occurred at a location along Campus Drive where the victim was residing.</p>
<p>Cunningham pleaded guilty to the charges shortly before jury selection was to begin for his trial.</p>

<p>At that time, Branca accepted a plea agreement under which Cunningham would be sentenced to 10 to 20 years in prison, followed by a consecutive three years of probation.</p>
<p>But before Branca could formally impose the sentence, Cunningham had to undergo a required evaluation by the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board, which had to determine if Cunningham meets criteria to be classified as a sexually violent predator. Those classified as predators face more stringent restrictions while on parole, including mandatory counseling and community notification about their housing arrangements.</p>
<p>According to testimony on Tuesday, the state board did recommend that Cunningham be classified as a predator.</p>
<p>Branca, who has to make the final determination, was prepared to hold a hearing on the state board’s recommendation on Tuesday. However, that hearing was also postponed when Cunningham revealed he wants to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>

<p>An investigation of Cunningham began at 6:38 p.m. July 3, 2024, when the victim’s mother contacted Upper Providence police to report that her daughter had been sexually assaulted by Cunningham while the girl was in his company earlier that day.</p>
<p>Cunningham indecently touched the girl and forcibly raped her, according to authorities.</p>
<p>The girl told detectives “she was shaking and moving” during the assault and that she told Cunningham “no, I don’t want to do that,” according to the criminal complaint filed by Upper Providence Detective Roy Stutz.</p>
<p>During the assault, Cunningham told the girl, “You have to do whatever I say now, and you better not tell anyone or it’s going to be a problem,” according to the arrest affidavit.</p>
<p>When Cunningham was no longer at the location, the girl told her mother she had been raped. The victim was taken to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in King of Prussia for a sexual assault examination.</p>
<p>Authorities alleged that after he was arrested, Cunningham reached out to the girl and attempted to intimidate her to withhold testimony at a trial.</p>
<p>Had the case gone to trial last August, prosecutors were prepared to present DNA evidence that linked Cunningham to the sexual assault, according to testimony.</p>
<p>In addition to the rape charge, Cunningham faces charges of corruption of a minor, unlawful contact with a minor, aggravated indecent assault of a minor, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and intimidation of a witness.</p>
