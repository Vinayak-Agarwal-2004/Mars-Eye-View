The court pointed out clearly that Lai Chee-ying was the mastermind of the case. He had manipulated and exploited Apple Daily to poison the society, and repeatedly colluded with external forces to beg for sanctions and hostile activities against the Central Authorities and the HKSAR Government. Even after the enactment of the HKNSL, all the defendants continued with their agreement for some time until after they were arrested by the Police. The court clearly pointed out that Lai Chee-ying’s only intent was to seek the downfall of the Communist Party of China even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of China and the HKSAR. Lai Chee-ying has brought harm to our country and Hong Kong; his evil deeds were beyond measure, and he for sure deserves his punishment after all the harm he has done.”</p></blockquote><p>An <em>SCMP</em> <a href="https://www.scmp.com/opinion/comment/article/3342955/jimmy-lai-trial-shows-hong-kongs-rule-law-remains-robust">editorial</a> says the trial ‘shows Hong Kong’s rule of law remains robust’…</p><blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"><p>Lai was found to have led plots to instigate sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland China and to have incited public hatred towards the authorities.

Liu is often said to have “advocated” or “prescribed” three centuries under foreign colonization to transform China along the same lines as Hong Kong.
