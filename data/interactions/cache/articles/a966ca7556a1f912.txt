       — A federal judge on Jan. 28 issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents of the

       administration is illegally targeting lawfully present refugees in order to trigger a mass termination of refugee status, rendering them vulnerable to deportation, according to the news release.</p><p>“For more than two weeks, refugees in Minnesota have been living in terror of being hunted down and disappeared to Texas,” said Kimberly Grano, a litigation staff attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, in the new release. “This temporary restraining order will immediately put in place desperately-needed guardrails on

       and protect resettled refugees from being unlawfully targeted for arrest and detention.”</p>
    
      
    
      <p>In his order, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim stated, “Refugees have a legal right to be in the United States, a right to work, a right to live peacefully — and importantly — a right not to be subjected to the terror of being arrested and detained without warrants or cause in their homes or on their way to religious services or to buy groceries. At its best, America serves as a haven of individual liberties in a world too often full of tyranny and cruelty. We abandon that ideal when we subject our neighbors to fear and chaos.”</p><p>It appears that the

       enforcement that has taken place in Willmar during the last few weeks in Willmar is at least partially under Operation PARRIS, which was announced Jan. 9. The focus of the operation is to reassess 5,600 refugees living in Minnesota who entered the United States during the

       administration but who have not been given lawful permanent resident status.   </p><p>Those who work with the refugee community have come to realize that, rather than being called into an immigration office or immigration court to be reassessed, those individuals are being arrested and detained by the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p>Under Operation PARRIS, armed ICE agents have been going door-to-door arresting members of the Minnesota refugee community, including children and the elderly, and sending them to detention camps in Texas, according to the news release.</p><p>Some of the refugees were subjected to intense questioning, according to the news release. Others remained imprisoned for more than a week, and many shuffled between facilities in shackles. Those who have been released were left on the streets of Texas, usually without money, identification or any way to get home.</p>
    
      
    
      <p>Along with halting the arrest and detention of immigrants in Minnesota who hold refugee status, the temporary restraining order also states that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, within five days, must release all detained refugees in Minnesota and also those who have been sent to detention facilities outside of Minnesota. </p><p>It is unclear if the department has followed the restraining order and released refugees who have been arrested in Minnesota. The department did not respond to email inquiries sent by the West Central Tribune to multiple contacts.</p><p>The 
    
      <a class="Link " href="https://worldrelief.org/" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">World Relief Organization</a>
    
       on Thursday conducted an online town hall meeting with those in Minnesota who work with the refugee community to discuss the judge’s decision and how that will affect their work.</p><p>World Relief was founded in the aftermath of World War II as a global Christian humanitarian organization that partners with local churches and communities to develop sustainable, locally driven solutions to some of the world's most urgent problems, according to its website.</p><p>“Most of us are aware that we’ve been in a season of very significant immigration enforcement for much of the past year, and a lot of the rhetoric has been about going after the worst of the worst — people convicted of violent crimes,” said Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at World Relief. “I want to be really clear, at World Relief we affirm the role of the government in detaining and, with due process, deporting criminals.”</p><p>He explained that what concerns those who work with refugees is that the federal government is going beyond immigrants who pose a threat to public safety and targeting those who are lawfully in the United States and abruptly revoking their legal status.</p><p>It is unknown how many people from the Willmar community have been arrested and detained by federal agents. The Department of Homeland Security is not responding to requests from the West Central Tribune and other media outlets seeking that information.</p>
    
      
    
      <p>During the town hall, Rebekah Phillips, executive director of programs at Arrive Ministries, said it is estimated that there have been more than 100 refugees arrested and detained in Minnesota, with the majority of them being transferred immediately to Texas.</p><p>Robyn Brown, director of Immigration Programs at World Relief and an immigration attorney, explained that those living in the U.S. under refugee status are those who have been vetted and met the legal definition of refugee and lawfully admitted into the U.S.</p><p>“Someone remains a refugee from the time they are bid until they become a green card holder, if they do apply for a green card,” Brown said, referring to the common name for the card that identifies a person as a permanent resident. “Not applying for a green card is not a reason that they can be deported. It is not a ground of removal that they can be put into removal proceedings for. So it is a surprise to us as well that this sort of activity is happening … seemingly on the basis that they simply don’t have a green card yet.”</p><p>Some of the individuals being arrested and detained have filed for a green card, but it has not yet been processed by the U.S. government. It often takes more than a year to process a green card application, according to Brown. Currently, all applications by refugees for green cards have been paused.</p><p>“We believe that the reason that Homeland Security is basically asserting for why they can detain these individuals, which we would disagree with, is that there is a provision in the 
    
      <a class="Link " href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/legislation/immigration-and-nationality-act" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Immigration and Nationality Act</a>
    
       that does discuss that someone who has been here in refugee status for a year and does not have a green card shall return or be returned to the custody of the Department of Homeland Security for examination and inspection,” Brown added.</p><p>She added that “custody” and “examination and inspection” has never been interpreted or implemented to mean actual physical arrest and detention of these individuals, which is what is being argued in court.</p><p>Discussed in the town hall is how Operation PARRIS has affected the immigrant community, with people being afraid to leave their homes to go to school or work, to shop or even to keep medical appointments. However, organizations in local communities have come together to support those who are afraid to leave their homes, delivering food and hygiene items and offering rides to and from work and medical appointments to provide a sense of safety.</p>
    
      
    
      <p>Schools are offering online learning and medical professionals are offering e-visits or even going to the homes of patients to provide medical care.  </p>
    
      
    
      <p>Phillips said that the stories shared by those who have been detained and since released show that Operation PARRIS is being carried out inconsistently.</p><p>“We’ve heard firsthand from their experiences. We know that it has varied. There have been inconsistencies in some of the processes that they’ve received, but one thing that most of them have communicated is that they are often unsure of why the detention is taking place,” Phillips said. “Some of them have been offered these re-vetting interviews, others have experienced something different than that. And so overall, I would say, many are confused and afraid. Many who have been released fear being re-detained, and we still have questions around that at this time. And so I would say, in general, the impact on refugees in Minnesota has been great and concerning.”</p><p>Brown explained the temporary restraining order pertains only to refugees detained in Minnesota under Operation PARRIS, or those detained originally in Minnesota and now being held elsewhere. </p><p>“There will be further developments in the case,” Brown said, noting there is another hearing on Feb. 19 regarding the ongoing merits of the case. “ … It’s possible that this could get appealed by the Department of Homeland Security, and so we’ll see if it sticks. But, it is a good sign, and Judge Tunheim has written a strong opinion that analyzes and explains where this is found to be unlawful actions … by Homeland Security. And so hopefully that will get upheld as the case continues.”</p>
