<p>Local communities across the country along with some state and local officials are resisting attempts by President Donald Trump to house thousands of detained immigrants in their areas in converted warehouses, privately run facilities and county jails. These are immigrant prisons.</p>
<p>In red states, red counties and red towns and  cities, people are pushing back so hard that ICE officials are having troubles finding locations for their detention centers. In Texas, in Oklahoma, in Utah, in New Mexico, in Virginia, proposed ICE facilities are running into brick walls by grassroots resistance.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trumps-45-billion-expansion-immigrant-detention-sites-faces-pushback-c-rcna257228">MSNOW reports</a>:</p>
<p>Federal officials have been scouting cities and counties across the U.S. for places to hold immigrants as they roll out a massive $45 billion expansion of detention facilities financed by Trump’s recent tax-cutting law.</p>
<p>The fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti during immigration enforcement actions in Minnesota have amplified an already intense spotlight on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, increasing scrutiny of its plans for new detention sites.</p>
<p>For instance, officials in Social Circle, Georgia, El Paso, Texas, and Roxbury Township, New Jersey, all have raised concerns about their locales being used and they all cite a lack of water and sewer capacity to transform warehouses into detention sites.</p>
<p>A proposed ICE facility just north of<strong> Richmond, Virginia</strong>, drew hundreds of people last week to a tense public hearing of the Hanover County Board of Supervisors. “You want what’s happening in Minnesota to go down in our own backyard? Build that detention center here, and that’s exactly what will happen,” resident Kimberly Matthews told county officials.</p>
<p>As a prospective ICE detention site became public, elected officials in <strong>Kansas City, Missouri,</strong> scrambled to pass an ordinance aimed at blocking it. And mayors in Oklahoma City and Salt Lake City – after raising concerns about building permits – announced last week that property owners won’t be selling or leasing their facilities for immigration detention…. Despite court rulings elsewhere, the City Council in Kansas City voted in January to impose a five-year moratorium on non-city-run detention facilities. The vote came on the same day ICE officials toured a nearly 1-million-square-foot (92,903-square-meter) warehouse as a prospective site. …</p>
<p>Legislatures in several Democratic-led states pressed forward with bills aimed at blocking or discouraging ICE facilities. A <strong>New Mexico</strong> measure targets local government agreements to detain immigrants for ICE. A novel <strong>California</strong> proposal seeks to nudge companies running ICE facilities out of the state by imposing a 50% tax on their proceeds.</p>
<p>The Democratic-led<strong> New Mexico</strong> House on Friday passed legislation banning state and local government contracts for ICE detention facilities, sending it to the Senate.</p>
<p>Similar bills are pending in <strong>Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York</strong> and <strong>Rhode Island</strong>.</p>
<p>The Otero County Processing Center, 25 miles (40 kilometers) from downtown <strong>El Paso, Texas,</strong> is one of three privately run ICE facilities that could be affected by the New Mexico legislation. The facility includes four immigration courtrooms and space for more than 1,000 detainees. The county financed its construction in 2007 with the intent to use it as a revenue source, and plans to pay off the remaining $16.5 million debt by 2028.</p>
<p>County boards, city councils, regulatory agencies are being inundated by crowds of citizens aiming to stop whatever warehouse locally is being eyed by the Trump administration –and many are voting against the detention schemes.</p>
<p>Since taking office, Trump has doubled the number of ICE detention sites. The US government now is detaining 73,000 people, up from 40,000 a little over a year ago.</p>
<p>In a little over a year, the number of detention facilities used by ICE nearly doubled to 212 sites spread across 47 states and territories. Most of that growth came through existing contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service or deals to use empty beds at county jails.</p>
<p>Trump’s administration now is taking steps to open more large-scale facilities. In January, ICE paid $102 million for a warehouse in Washington County, Maryland, $84 million for one in Berks County, Pennsylvania, and more than $70 million for one in Surprise, Arizona. It also solicited public comment on a proposed warehouse purchase in a flood plain in Chester, New York.</p>
<p>Federal immigration officials have toured large warehouses elsewhere, without releasing many details about the efforts.</p>
<p>“They will be very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards,” ICE said in a statement, adding: “It should not come as news that ICE will be making arrests in states across the U.8. and is actively working to expand detention space.”</p>
<p>This on-going process will continue to be played out as more and more citizens of even -yes, red states – discover Trump’s plans and then mobilizing their neighbors to stop the attempt to hold immigrants in warehouses.</p>
<p>But it is good news to know that many of our fellow Americans are not taking this all sitting down. In many parts of the country ICE is more despised than the devil. There is a struggle of resistance that all of us will have to join if we’re going to save the US of A.</p>
