<p>Public security authorities in several places have uncovered multiple cases of people voluntarily sneaking into Southeast Asia to engage in telecom fraud, exposing the harsh reality behind the illusion of "high-paying quick wealth."</p> 
<p>Authorities have issued a stern warning that Southeast Asia is by no means a "quick money paradise", and those who voluntarily participate in telecom fraud there will face severe legal consequences alongside huge personal safety risks.</p> 
<p>Recently, a high-profile case involved two 20-year-olds from Shangrao, Jiangxi province, who went missing in August 2025 after traveling to Yunnan province, and were later found in a telecom fraud park in Cambodia, sparking public concern, with rumors claiming the pair were "abducted and trafficked".</p> 
<p>Investigations revealed that before illegally crossing the border from the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, the two had attempted to smuggle out of the country via Pu'er in Yunnan, on July 30, 2025. They were intercepted by border checkpoint officers, who made them sign a letter of informed commitment and notified their parents of the risks. Undeterred, the pair traveled to Guangxi, on Aug 1.</p> 
<p>On the afternoon of Aug 3, they met two other would-be illegal immigrants in a hotel lobby, and the four took a ride-hailing car to areas near the China-Vietnam border. With the help of human smugglers, they sneaked into Vietnam and then proceeded to Cambodia, entering the country via the Vietnam-Cambodia border on Aug 6.</p> 
<p>They were captured by Chinese police on Jan 16. During questioning, the two confessed they were tempted by an online ad recruiting "high-paid backpackers" that promised a commission of 50,000 to 100,000 yuan ($7,200 to $14,400). Eager to make money quickly, they contacted the advertiser on their own initiative. Upon arriving at the fraud park in Cambodia, their mobile phones were confiscated, but they still had access to family contact channels, an option they chose not to use.</p> 
<p>The pair progressed from training to formal duties as fraud operators, providing "customer service" and gaining experience in scamming activities.</p> 
<p>Thanks to China-Cambodia law enforcement cooperation and assistance from the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, the two were sent to the China-Vietnam border on Jan 16. They tried to sneak back into China illegally and were apprehended by police in Guangxi, the same day. On Jan 18, they were placed in criminal detention by police in Shangrao on charges of illegal border crossing and fraud.</p> 
<p>In another case, 18-year-old Hu Yixiao from Lujiang county, Anhui province, dropped out of high school before the college entrance exam due to poor grades. After failing to find success in working to "prove himself", he was deceived by an online ad in June last year claiming he could earn 100,000 yuan per trip by "carrying gold across the border".</p> 
<p>He voluntarily smuggled into northern Myanmar but was sold to a fraud park, where he suffered illegal detention, beatings and exposure to extreme heat, and was forced to participate in fraud. Though he managed to return to China, he still received administrative punishment for illegal border crossing.</p> 
<p>"High-paying recruitment combined with illegal border crossing is a typical sign of telecom fraud activities overseas. The public must stay alert to such ads," said Tong Jiaqing, political commissar of the criminal investigation detachment of Shangrao Public Security Bureau.</p> 
<p>"Those who smuggle abroad to engage in telecom fraud should not harbor illusions. Public security authorities will severely punish such crimes regardless of whether they are committed domestically or overseas."</p> 
<p>Since May 2021, the Ministry of Public Security has launched a special operation to cut off the "flow of people" involved in illegal immigration for telecom fraud, target human smugglers, block smuggling routes, and reduce the space for overseas fraud activities.</p> 
<p>The MPS announced early January plans to strengthen border control, establish emergency interception mechanisms, and severely crack down on human traffickers, while eliminating exit routes for fraud-related individuals. Additionally, efforts will be made to eliminate the criminal environment and provide education and guidance for those involved in fraud.</p>
