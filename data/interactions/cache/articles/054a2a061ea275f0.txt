        <p>Abuja, Feb. 10, 2026 (NAN) Troops of 12 Brigade Nigerian Army have rescued 14 kidnapped victims in Kogi following sustained offensive operations against terrorists within forest enclaves around Lokoja axis.</p>
<p>A credible military source told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Abuja on Tuesday, that the rescue followed a successful assault on Batijjo’s camp in the Adonkolo/Kakanda Forest.</p>
<p>The source said that the troops engaged terrorists in a firefight and overran the camp, forcing the criminals to flee.</p>
<p>He said the troops recovered weapons, ammunition, military and police camouflage, and documents, including a foreign passport during the operations, further degrading the terrorists’ operational capability.</p>
<p>According to him, one of the rescued victims was identified as a serving soldier abducted while traveling from Abeokuta to Zaria, while all rescued persons were stabilised by medical teams.</p>
<p>”In a follow-up ambush at Tajimi, troops engaged a fleeing terrorist who abandoned his motorcycle before escaping, the motorcycle was recovered for intelligence exploitation.</p>
<p>”Troops also responded swiftly to a kidnapping incident along the Okene–Onyukoko road, rescuing seven escapees, as search-and-rescue operations continue for remaining victims,” he said.</p>
<p>The source reaffirmed the Nigerian army’s resolve to sustain aggressive operations to dismantle terrorist networks and restore security across Kogi and adjoining areas. (NAN)(</p>
