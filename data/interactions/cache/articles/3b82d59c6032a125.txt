<p>Armed Israeli settlers have carried out a series of new attacks across the occupied West Bank, injuring several Palestinians in different locations, local media reports say.</p>
<p>According to the Palestinian WAFA news agency, incidents near Nablus and Ramallah included physical assaults, road blockades, and property targeting.</p>
<p>In the first incident, settlers assaulted at least three Palestinians working on their land in the town of Beit Imrin, north of Nablus, leaving them with bruises and injuries.</p>
<p>One of the wounded was transferred to the hospital by the Palestinian Red Crescent.</p>
<p>In a separate incident east of Ramallah, two Palestinians were injured after settlers blocked a road between Ramoun village and Deir Dibwan town before assaulting them.</p>
<p>One sustained a head injury and required hospitalization. Additional assaults were reported in the town of Qusra, south of Nablus.</p>
<p>Local sources also reported attacks in the northern Jordan Valley and near al-Mughayyir village, where settlers targeted caves and agricultural areas.</p>
<p>Separately, the Israeli army said it shot a Palestinian detainee inside a military base in the Jordan Valley after alleging he attacked a soldier.</p>
<p>Israeli media reported the man, in his 50s, had been arrested at the Allenby Bridge crossing a day earlier and transferred to a military facility where he was shot in the knees, sustaining injuries.</p>
<p>Israeli forces also conducted raids across multiple towns and refugee camps, firing tear gas and storming homes in al-Bireh, the Amari camp, eastern Lubban, al-Mughayyir, and Kafr Aqab.</p>
<p>In Azzun, east of Qalqilya, soldiers seized a house and turned it into a military post.</p>
<p>In Yatta, south of al-Khalil, two Palestinians were detained, including a local council head and a resident who confronted settlers grazing livestock near his home.</p>
<p>Several vehicles were confiscated, and residents were interrogated in additional searches across the region.</p>
<p>Settlers escorted by Israeli forces have carried out hundreds of attacks against Palestinians and their property in recent months, targeting farmland, roads and homes.</p>
<p>The incidents come amid intensified Israeli military offensive in the West Bank since the start of the Tel Aviv regime's genocidal war on Gaza in October 2023, including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion.</p>
<p>At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed, about 11,500 wounded and more than 21,000 detained during this period.</p>
<p>Drop Site News, in a report on Saturday, revealed that since the start of Israel's war on Gaza on October 7, 2023, an estimated 10,000 Palestinians have been displaced within the occupied West Bank, with entire villages dismantled and erased.</p>
<p>In July 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and called for the evacuation of settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, a decision that remains unimplemented.</p>
