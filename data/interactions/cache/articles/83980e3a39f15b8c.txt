                                                      <p><strong>Tensions are rising in the Horn of Africa after Eritrea forcefully rejected Ethiopian claims that its troops are operating inside Ethiopian territory.</strong></p>
<p>Asmara called the accusations “false and fabricated,” after Ethiopia demanded Eritrean forces withdraw, accusing them of backing insurgents fighting federal troops, particularly in the Amhara region.</p>
<p>Eritrea’s Information Minister says the allegations were part of a hostile campaign against his country and insisted Eritrea has no desire to escalate tensions.</p>

<p>Relations between the two neighbours have long been volatile. Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia in 1993, but the countries later fought a brutal border war that killed tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Although Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed once pursued peace, earning a Nobel Prize, the alliance fractured after the Tigray war, which killed at least 600,000 people.</p>
<p>Disputes over troop withdrawals, rebel alliances, and Ethiopia’s push for sea access continue to strain an already fragile relationship.</p>
