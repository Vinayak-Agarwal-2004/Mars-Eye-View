<p>Israeli forces have <a href="https://t.me/MOHMediaGaza/7271">killed at least 529 Palestinians in Gaza</a> since the ceasefire deal was supposed to go into effect in early October, Gaza’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday, as the IDF continues its constant violations of the US-backed truce.</p>



<p>The Health Ministry said that another 1,462 Palestinians have been injured in that time, meaning there have been nearly 2,000 Palestinian casualties. </p>



<p>The ministry’s count is based on the number of dead and wounded Palestinians who arrive at hospitals, and it points out in each press release that a “number of victims are still under the rubble and in the streets, as ambulance and civil defense crews have been unable to reach them so far.”</p>

<p>IDF officials<a href="https://t.me/MOHMediaGaza/7269"> recently told Israeli media</a> that the ministry’s overall death toll, which reached 71,803 on Tuesday, is accurate and acknowledged that it doesn’t include missing Palestinians presumed dead under the rubble. Several studies have concluded that the real violent death toll is <a href="https://news.antiwar.com/2025/11/25/study-israeli-forces-likely-killed-more-than-100000-palestinians-in-gaza/">likely near or over 100,000.</a></p>



<p>The IDF launched more attacks in Gaza on Tuesday, which continue every day despite the US declaring the second phase of the ceasefire deal and forming the so-called “Board of Peace.”</p>



<p>According to reports from the Strip, at least two Palestinians were killed by IDF fire on Tuesday. Turkey’s <em>Anadolu Agency </em><a href="https://www.trtworld.com/article/fdafa3815df8">reported</a> that a young man was killed after being shot by Israeli forces in the al-Mawasi tent camp in southern Gaza.</p>



<p>The Palestinian news agency <em>WAFA</em> <a href="https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/167059">reported</a> that a woman was killed by Israeli forces in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City. A child who was injured by an Israeli attack on al-Mawasi a day earlier also succumbed to his wounds.</p>
