rel="" title="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/christchurch/">Christchurch</a>, but lived in <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/timaru/" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/timaru/">Timaru</a>, where he ran a drug supply network. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">That involved the distribution of 3.5 kg of methamphetamine and cocaine.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Crown prosecutor Abbie Hollingworth said that while he was not the most senior member, he was an important link in the chain of a drug supply line between Auckland and Christchurch. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Hollingworth said he had autonomy and a management function over the Timaru drug supply network.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">He had a “tick list” with one key buyer and debts of $120,000 a week were described as “normal” for Bolstad. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">But it came crashing down when Operation Avon culminated in 21 arrests as police executed dozens of search warrants in Canterbury, with a handful in Auckland in August 2024. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">The <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/christchurch/" rel=""

National Organised Crime Group (NOCG) in early 2024, supported by Canterbury police</a>, as their offending spread across New Zealand.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Police found $45,000, a money counting machine and two boxes of ammunition at Bolstad’s Timaru address.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Defence lawyer Olivia Jarvis said drug addiction was a key driver in his offending, but Justice Jonathan Eaton disagreed, saying Bolstad was driven by gang membership.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Justice Eaton said reports showed Bolstad had no desire to separate himself from the Comancheros.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“He, like others I have read reports on, has expressed no desire to separate himself from the gang.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“The Comancheros have a strict rule not to use meth but they deal in it. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“So long as you are associated with the gang you are going to commit yourself to a life of offending.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“As long as he stays with the gang it’s not going to be good.”</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Justice Eaton said Bolstad would have had a good degree of knowledge of the gang’s operations.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">The court heard Bolstad had three daughters and had acknowledged the impact of his offending on them.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">Jarvis said he did desire to make changes “whether leaving the gang or not”.</p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“While he is staying loyal to the gang, his desires are to better himself. </p><p class="sOrINelcmiMRl">“He acknowledges that he placed his addiction above his children.”</p><div class="my-11"><div class="article-media sOrINelcmiMRl" data-test-ui="article-media"><figure class="figure" data-test-ui="figure"><img
