<p>"We do have some predatory tow truck operators in the city of Philly," <a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/news-blotter/philadelphia-police-seek-publics-help-in-locating-armed-and-dangerous-murder-suspect/" target="_blank">said Staff Inspector </a><a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/news-blotter/philadelphia-police-seek-publics-help-in-locating-armed-and-dangerous-murder-suspect/" target="_blank"><strong>Ernest Ransom</strong></a><a href="https://www.phillypolice.com/news-blotter/philadelphia-police-seek-publics-help-in-locating-armed-and-dangerous-murder-suspect/" target="_blank"> of the Philadelphia Police Department</a>. "I'm here to tell you now, there is no area they own in city of Philly," he told local media.</p>

<p>The first shooting occurred on December 22, 2025 when officers responded to a call at 4200 Torresdale Avenue. They discovered 20-year-old <strong>David Garcia-Morales</strong> inside a Ford F-450 towing vehicle with gunshot wounds to his neck and thigh. Garcia-Morales was transported to Temple University Hospital but died from his injuries four days later.</p>

<p>Williams is also <a href="https://6abc.com/post/police-identify-najee-williams-suspect-wanted-connection-deadly-tow-truck-shootings-northeast-philadelphia/18541605/" target="_blank">wanted for a second shooting that took place on January 11</a>, 2026. Police responding to the 2100 block of Knorr Street found 25-year-old <strong>Aaron Whitfield</strong> suffering from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body inside his tow truck. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A 21-year-old woman was also shot in the leg during this incident and was hospitalized in stable condition.</p>

<p>Surveillance footage shows a silver Honda pulling up beside Whitfield's parked tow truck before two people inside the car fired at least a dozen shots, according to police. The vehicle has since been recovered.</p>

<p>"We were able to determine Najee Williams was at both locations and committed both crimes," said Ransom.</p>

<p>On January 28, the District Attorney's Office <a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/suspect-wanted-najee-williams-tow-truck-shootings-philadelphia/4345249/" target="_blank">approved multiple charges against Williams including murder</a>, violation of firearms laws, conspiracy, possessing instruments of crime, and recklessly endangering another person.</p>

<p>Police are also investigating whether Williams might be connected to a November killing of another tow truck driver, though they haven't officially linked him to that case yet.</p>

<p>Williams was last seen in Montgomery County and is considered armed and dangerous. The public is cautioned not to approach him. A $20,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his arrest and conviction. Anyone with information on Williams' whereabouts is urged to call the Philadelphia Police Department's tip line at 215-686-TIPS (8477).</p>
