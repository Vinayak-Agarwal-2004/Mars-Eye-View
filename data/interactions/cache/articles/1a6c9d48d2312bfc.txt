The men did not appear to be blocking a road or marching, which is effectively banned in designated areas under a NSW law passed after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bondi-beach-shooting-sydney-australia" data-link-name="in body link">Bondi antisemitic terror attack</a>.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">Video showed that, as the men prayed, police officers descended on the group, grabbing those at the edge of the prayer group and dragging them along the ground.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton" data-link-name="in body link"><sub class="dcr-130mj7b">Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The men in prayer did not respond and continued to pray. Other protesters yelled at police “Leave them” and “They’re fucking praying”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">Charkawi said police had used violence at an otherwise peaceful protest.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“[Police were] so unhinged, so aggressive and so violent and had zero regard for anyone and anything in their way, even peaceful worshippers who were not in anyone’s way.”</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">Charkawi said he and his fellow worshippers were about 15 minutes behind schedule to hold sunset prayer towards the end of the demonstration.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">He said as he prayed, “we could obviously hear a big ruckus behind us. And I saw people … being flung off on my right, flung off on my left.”</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">In the footage, Charkawi can be seen continuing to kneel in prayer.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“When you’re in prayer, you’re not allowed to break it for any reason. There’s got to be a catastrophe, or some type of emergency that is happening, for us to do that,” he said.</p><figure id="4b830337-79ea-4014-b6e6-734c5955add9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.YoutubeBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"><gu-island name="YoutubeBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="visible" props='{"id":"28627f5d-875f-4886-a2fb-c9dde1a48d09","assetId":"u8sJz35wIp0","index":12,"format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0},"isMainMedia":false,"expired":false,"posterImage":"https://media.guim.co.uk/100c22c95b5277b74a6344172047fbb9549189ad/0_519_8192_4610/8192.jpg","duration":120,"mediaTitle":"Pepper spray and questionable police tactics: how a Sydney protest ended in chaos – video","origin":"https://www.theguardian.com","stickyVideos":false,"enableAds":true,"iconSizeOnDesktop":"large","iconSizeOnMobile":"large","hidePillOnMobile":false}'><div data-chromatic="ignore"><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"><span class="dcr-1alawo7"><svg viewbox="0 0 36 23"><path d="M3.2 0l-3.2 3.3v16.4l3.3 3.3h18.7v-23h-18.8m30.4 1l-8.6 8v5l8.6 8h2.4v-21h-2.4"></path></svg></span><span class="dcr-1qvd3m6">Pepper spray and questionable police tactics: how a Sydney protest ended in chaos – video</span></figcaption></div></gu-island></figure><p class="dcr-130mj7b">As he was pulled by police, he said he felt like his shoulder was nearly ripped out of its socket.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“We weren’t disobeying any police commands.

This was a peaceful protest, standing for people who were protesting a genocide on the other side of the world, but had made it explicit that we were inclusive of Jewish people.

Lanyon has spent nearly 40 years in the NSW police force and has been commissioner for five months.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The group said the NSW premier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/chris-minns" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Chris Minns</a>, should apologise for the police “abuse of power”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The coalition of Muslim organisations said the use of force against worshippers during a lawful and peaceful protest was unacceptable.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“Police officers knowingly intervened in a moment of religious observance, forcibly interrupted prayer and used physical force against individuals who posed no threat to public safety. Some worshippers were dragged away and thrown to the ground,” the group said in a statement.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“This was an abuse of power and a serious failure of judgment.”</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The group argued followers of no other faith would be expected to accept sacred practices being forcibly disrupted by police.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“Muslims should not be held to a different standard, nor should our religious expression be treated as a problem to be managed or suppressed,” the statement said.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The group called for an independent inquiry into the incident, and accountability – including potentially criminal charges – for individual officers found to have acted unlawfully.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"><gu-island name="EmailSignUpWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;index&quot;:27,&quot;listId&quot;:6048,&quot;identityName&quot;:&quot;breaking-news-australia&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Get the most important news as it breaks&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Breaking News Australia&quot;,&quot;frequency&quot;:&quot;When needed&quot;,&quot;successDescription&quot;:&quot;We'll send you Breaking News Australia when needed.&quot;,&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;news&quot;,&quot;idApiUrl&quot;:&quot;https://idapi.theguardian.com&quot;,&quot;hideNewsletterSignupComponentForSubscribers&quot;:true}"></gu-island></figure><figure id="680c474c-5506-450c-a3b6-d3dfa6fde1fb" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":28,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Sydney protest: NSW premier Chris Minns defends police in ‘impossible situation’ after video emerges of officers punching protesters","elementId":"680c474c-5506-450c-a3b6-d3dfa6fde1fb","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2026/feb/10/chris-minns-defends-police-in-impossible-situation-after-accusations-of-violence-against-protesters-in-sydney"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'></gu-island></figure><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The Australian National Imams Council said it was outraged by the police’s “heavy-handed” and unprovoked physicality.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“Police are entrusted to protect the community, uphold public safety and de-escalate tensions, not to interfere with religious worship or inflame an already sensitive situation.”</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">Lanyon defended his officers’ actions, saying they showed “remarkable restraint”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“Speakers were inciting the crowd to march.

It was, in effect, in the middle of a riot. Police have to make critical early decisions in those circumstances. It wasn’t designed to pick on or target a particular community.”</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, raised the issue of police action against praying protesters in parliament, saying he would “allow police to do their job” in investigating. He said many in Australia “will want to know all of the circumstances around that”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/28/sheikh-wesam-charkawi-reinstated-granville-boys-high-school-western-sydney-ntwnfb" data-link-name="in body link">Charkawi, a support officer at Granville Boys high school</a>, was last year ordered to work from home after posting a video in response to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/14/sydney-nurses-alleged-antisemitic-threats-full-video-released-ntwnfb" data-link-name="in body link">Bankstown hospital nurses</a> footage, in which he criticised “selective outrage”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">In his video, Charkawi said the nurses’ comments were “never meant to be literal or intended to be a threat to patient care” and criticised people who had spoken out about them but remained silent on Israel’s actions.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">A spokesperson for NSW police said the police commissioner had “reached out” to several leaders of the Muslim community in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Sydney</a>, seeking to reassure them of the police force’s commitment to an “ongoing mutually respectful relationship”.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“At no stage did officers intend to cause offence to community members,” the spokesperson said.</p><p class="dcr-130mj7b">“We understand the significance of worshippers being able to observe religious prayers; officers had issued a move-on direction to the entire crowd for public safety reasons.
