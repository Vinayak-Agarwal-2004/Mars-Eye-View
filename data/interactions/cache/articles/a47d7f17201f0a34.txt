(Representative Image: Reuters)</p></figure></div><p id="0" class="story_para_0">When a neighbour changes the head of the family, relationships often take a nosedive or are rebuilt. This is even more likely in a particularly volatile neighbourhood like India’s.</p><p id="1" class="story_para_1">With at least five nations either going to polls in early 2026 or have just concluded the process in India’s immediate and distant backyard, it is time to assess the nation’s ability to influence, accommodate, and assimilate the outcomes with its own regional ambitions.</p><p id="2" class="story_para_2">Myanmar and Thailand just finished choosing representatives, while tumultuous Bangladesh polls are on Thursday. Nepal elections are scheduled on March 5 and single-party Vietnam chooses its representatives to Parliament on March 15.</p><p id="3" class="story_para_3">Let us have a quick look at each of these elections and why their outcomes are important for India.</p><p id="4" class="story_para_4"></p><h2>Myanmar (concluded January):</h2><p></p><p id="5" class="story_para_5">Myanmar’s phased parliamentary election, held from December 2025 to January 2026, has been widely touted as a sham carried out by the military junta to legitimise its rule five years after the 2021 coup.</p><p id="6" class="story_para_6">The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/24/myanmar-election-china-junta/" rel="nofollow"><em>Washington Post</em> reported</a>: “Myanmar’s military choreographs an election, with Beijing’s help: With war raging in large parts of the country, the junta staged a vote to cement its power."</p><p id="7" class="story_para_7">The junta-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) won by a landslide, getting over 72 per cent of contested seats (231 in the lower house and 108 in the upper house) amid low turnout, voter repression, and exclusion of major opposition like the Aung San Suu Kyi-led National League for Democracy.</p><p id="8" class="story_para_8">The outcome cements junta leader Min Aung Hlaing’s control, with no end to the civil war and instability.</p><p id="9" class="story_para_9">Myanmar’s military authoritarianism complicates India’s ‘Act East’ policy. Large parts of the 1,643 km shared frontier remains vulnerable and out of the junta’s control, providing free space for anti-India insurgent activity, especially across the border from Mizoram and Manipur.</p><p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails"></p><p id="10" class="story_para_10">Junta rule also tends to trigger refugee flow of Rohingyas. Lawless zones become ripe ground for ISI training camps for Bangladeshi jihadis.</p><p id="11" class="story_para_11">While India maintains pragmatic ties with the Myanmar military to counter Chinese influence, the election outcome may force New Delhi to deepen engagement with ethnic armed groups for stability, potentially escalating regional tensions amid ongoing arms trade and infrastructure projects like the Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project.</p><p id="12" class="story_para_12"></p><h2>Thailand (concluded February 8):</h2><p></p><p id="13" class="story_para_13">Thailand’s snap House of Representatives election on February 8, 2026, sprung a conservative resurgence which left many including western observers nonplussed. Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul’s Bhumjaithai Party secured around 193 seats in the 500-member lower house, defying polls which favored progressives.</p><p id="14" class="story_para_14">Voter turnout dropped to 65 per cent, reflecting fatigue amid economic challenges and border clashes with Cambodia. The progressive People’s Party won 116 seats, while Pheu Thai took 74. It signalled a preference for stability, nationalism, and respect for the monarchy over reformist agendas like changes in the lèse-majesté law which punishes people for insulting or threatening the royalty.</p><p id="15" class="story_para_15">Bhumjaithai’s coalition will ensure policy continuity in areas like cannabis decriminalisation and defence.</p><p id="16" class="story_para_16">For India, a stable conservative government in Thailand bolsters bilateral economic ties, with trade already exceeding $15 billion annually. Free trade agreement negotiations and investments in India’s Northeast via the India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway is likely to gain pace.</p><p id="17" class="story_para_17"></p><h2>Bangladesh (February 12):</h2><p></p><p id="18" class="story_para_18">This is the trickiest one.</p><p id="19" class="story_para_19">Bangladesh’s general election and referendum comes after a bloody regime-change op and Sheikh Hasina’s ouster followed by wantonly violent 18 months under chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.</p><p id="20" class="story_para_20">The elections are far from inclusive, with Awami League bullied out of the reckoning as 127 million voters decide 300 parliamentary seats alongside a referendum on constitutional reforms. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is the frontrunner, but rising Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami and youth-backed National Citizen Party (NCP) may spring a surprise, especially with the US believed to be backing religious extremists to meet its own regional goals.</p><p id="21" class="story_para_21">Even in the worst case scenario of the Islamist Jamaat coming to power, India has the pragmatism and leverage to turn things around to its advantage the way it did post the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. Bangladesh poses additional challenges of managing the still-porous 4,096 km frontier and the huge number of illegals who have already entered India and procured documents using corrupt officials and agents.</p><p id="22" class="story_para_22">Then there is the looming Chinese influence over Bangladesh to counter. Overall, Bangladesh is going to be India’s toughest challenge, whatever the outcome of its elections.</p><p id="23" class="story_para_23"></p><h2>Nepal (March 5):</h2><p></p><p id="24" class="story_para_24">Nepal’s midterm House of Representatives election follows the Gen-Z uprising which dissolved Parliament. The youth will continue to play a major role when 18.9 million voters elect 275 members (165 first past the post, 110 proportional representation).</p><p id="25" class="story_para_25">Opinion polls favor Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) at 71 per cent, Nepali Congress at 26 per cent, and CPN-UML at 9 per cent, highlighting a clash between emerging reformists like Balen Shah and traditional elites.</p><p id="26" class="story_para_26">Nepal election results directly affect India’s Himalayan border security and hydropower cooperation. If RSP wins, it will usher pro-India policies amid monarchy restoration debates, countering Chinese infrastructure plans like BRI. But if instability returns, it could spill over into Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, affecting trade ($10 billion annually) and people-to-people ties. A UML resurgence will push Kathmandu towards Beijing.</p><p id="27" class="story_para_27"></p><h2>Vietnam (March 15):</h2><p></p><p id="28" class="story_para_28">Vietnam’s general election will pick 500 deputies to the 16th National Assembly, with the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) monopoly intact. It will ratifying January 2026 Congress decisions like To Lam’s reappointment as General Secretary. These focus on endorsing an ambitious 10 per cent annual growth target to 2030, underlines security, anti-corruption, and economic reforms amid US-China rivalry, and leadership continuity under Lam.</p><p id="29" class="story_para_29">Vietnam’s CPV-led stability boosts Indo-Vietnam strategic partnership in defence (example, BrahMos missiles) and trade ($15 billion target), countering China in the South China Sea. Steep growth targets of both countries could propel economic synergies in electronics and textiles. Overall, one of the sunniest spots in the larger neighbourhood.</p><p id="30" class="story_para_30"><em><strong>Abhijit Majumder is the author of the book, ‘India’s New Right’.
