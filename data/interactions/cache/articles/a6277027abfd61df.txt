The protests failed to trigger electoral reforms, but became the catalyst for several years of escalating resistance that culminated in the 2019 protests and Beijing’s eventual imposition of the national security law.</p><p>Wong co-founded Demosisto, a pro-democracy political party launched in 2016 from the student-led movements of the 2010s. The party was disbanded on June 30, 2020, the same day the national security law was enacted.</p><p>Wong has been arrested and jailed multiple times over the years for protest-related offences, including unlawful assembly and once for participating in a Tiananmen vigil after the 2020 ban. Last year, Wong was convicted in the HK47 trial, and was sentenced to four years and eight months in prison.</p><p>However, in June last year, he was again charged with conspiring to collude with foreign forces – also under the national security law.</p><p>He has been accused of conspiring to ask foreign countries, institutions, organisations or individuals outside China to impose sanctions or blockades. He awaits trial for this charge.</p><h3>Nathan Law</h3><p>Nathan Law, who co-founded Demosisto with Wong, fled Hong Kong in 2020 after China imposed the sweeping security law.</p><p>In 2021, Law, who also previously served as a local legislator in Hong Kong, was granted asylum in the United Kingdom. Hong Kong authorities have offered rewards of one million Hong Kong dollars ($128,000) for information on him.</p><p>Law was alleged to be a co-conspirator with Wong in the latest charge of “foreign collusion” brought against them last year. He remains wanted by Hong Kong authorities, with arrest warrants issued under the security law.</p><h3>Agnes Chow</h3><p>Chow, the third co-founder of Demosisto alongside Wong and Law, is living in exile in Canada.</p><p>Now 29, she was arrested in 2020 and received a 10-month jail sentence for participating in an unauthorised assembly during the 2019 demonstrations.
