                                <p>After five months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, Fort Wayne business owner Paramjit Singh is home.</p><p>Singh, 48, was taken into custody July 30 when he returned to the United States from a trip to India, despite having a valid green card, according to Luis Angeles, his attorney.</p><p>“From the beginning, it was all just talking points to make him look bad,” Angeles said. “At the end, justice prevailed. We were able to show enough that he deserves to be released.”</p><p>Singh immigrated to the United States from India in 1994. Angeles said his parents, who are U.S. citizens, petitioned for him.</p><p>He was convicted in 1999 of theft for failing to pay to use a payphone. Angeles said that must have been why the government detained him on July 30 at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, even though that conviction didn’t invalidate Singh’s green card.</p><p>In October, Tricia McLaughlin, deputy secretary of public affairs for the Department of Homeland Security, called Singh a “criminal illegal alien” with a larceny conviction, and her statement said he was part of the reason for the White House’s crackdown on illegal immigration.</p><p>Angeles said the government’s case was built on that conviction being enough to deport Singh.</p><p>“We were able to show that his conviction was not what they said it was,” he said.</p><p>Once the conviction was vacated, the government no longer had a reason to hold or deport Singh. The government’s attorneys advised the Department of Homeland Security that keeping Singh in custody would be unlawful, Angeles said. The department then filed to dismiss the case, and Singh was released Jan. 6.</p><p>“From my understanding, he was in tears,” Angeles said, referring to when Singh found out about the dismissal. “He was just grateful that someone as able to hear him out and see that he’s not the person they painted him out to be.”</p><p>Singh’s release came one day before Renee Good was fatally shot by federal immigration enforcement agents. Less than three weeks later, federal agents killed Alex Pretti. Both U.S. citizens were shot in Minneapolis.</p><p>Singh has health concerns that Angeles said were not being properly treated, including what his family suspects is a brain tumor, while in federal custody.</p><p>Singh has a wife and two minor children at home. He owns 16 gas stations in Fort Wayne. For privacy concerns, Angeles would not say what gas stations or the name of Singh’s company, but the company is building two distribution centers, one in Ohio and one in Fort Wayne.</p><p>“My client was never a criminal,” Angeles said. “He’s been here as a legal, permanent resident for many years, has contributed to our economy, has contributed to our fabric of our nation, and as an attorney, I feel proud that justice was served.”</p><p>Angeles said Singh’s case should be an example to doubters of the U.S. immigration system.</p><p>“Mr. Singh did the right thing,” he said. “He came into the United States the right way. He’s an example of the American dream. He is the example of how the right and the left claims we should do it. He was falsely accused of many nasty things, but we’re going to look past that because now, he’s a free man with his family.”</p><p>Angeles said Singh is working on getting his U.S. citizenship. Singh was not available for comment Tuesday. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
