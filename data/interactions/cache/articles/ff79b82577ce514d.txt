		<p>The Supreme Court should approve a settlement deal in the more than decadelong legal battle over the Rio Grande, a special master recommended in a new report.</p>
<p>Judge D. Brooks Smith of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, who is acting as special master in <i>Texas v. New Mexico and Colorado</i>, on Friday <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22O141/395802/20260209140154807_No.%2022O141%20Report%20of%20the%20Special%20Master.pdf" target="_blank">issued a report</a> endorsing a settlement agreement between the states and federal government. His report, which also advocated for dismissing the lawsuit, was published Monday.</p>
<p>“Much like the river whose water the parties have quarreled over for decades, this original action has proceeded in a meandering fashion,” Smith wrote.</p>
	
    
    
<p>The states <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/09/02/states-reach-new-settlement-over-rio-grande-00539958" target="_blank">unveiled their settlement</a> last fall, detailing an agreement in which New Mexico would forfeit 5.9 billion gallons of groundwater annually to ensure Texas receives its full share of Rio Grande water. The three-part deal also includes the creation of a new water management plan.</p>    </div>
