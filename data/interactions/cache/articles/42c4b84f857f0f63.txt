Should Mathre be convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison. In comparison, the charges Mathre faces regarding the threat to Vance carry a five-year maximum sentence.</p><p class="text | article-text">“Our attorneys are vigorously prosecuting this disgusting threat against Vice President Vance,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said. “You can hide behind a screen, but you cannot hide from this Department of Justice.”</p><p class="copyright |"><i>Copyright 2026 WTVG via Gray Local Media, Inc.
