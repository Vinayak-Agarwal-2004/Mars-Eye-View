Officers stopped the car she was traveling in and detained her on suspicion of inciting racial hatred.</p></section><section id="section-17" class="article-default-section article-body-paragraph"><p>Aladwan subsequently revealed that the woman was Abouchakra, blaming her arrest on the “<a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/article-777425">Zionist lobby</a>.”<br>Abouchakra, 35, has been a prominent figure on Press TV’s “Palestine Declassified” program, where she has criticized Israeli policies and Zionist influence on Western institutions.</p></section><section id="section-18" class="article-paragraph-wrap"><p class="article-paragraph-section article-body-paragraph">Press TV is the Islamic Republic of Iran’s first international news network.

warned about the risks posed by Iranian state media in the United Kingdom, noting the radicalizing impact it can have and how it can provide <a

officer and one of the architects behind two of the UK’s National Security Strategies as part of Britain’s National Security Secretariat, told The Jerusalem Post that the UK was likely finally taking action against Tehran’s “agents,” as it has become increasingly impossible to ignore the human rights violations committed by the Islamic regime.</p></section><section id="section-29"

that’s it… I think that the obscenity of Iranian government action against their own people means that it’s no longer possible to ignore the dogged open-source investigators.”</p></section><section
