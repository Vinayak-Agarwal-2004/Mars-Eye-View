        <p>The whole country has been waiting for months—it seems like years—to find out what the most impressive, articulate political figure in modern American history was going to do in 2028. I’m speaking, of course, about Kamala Harris.<br>
 <br>
Obviously, I’m joking.<br>
 <br>
Her big announcement Thursday was a relaunch of her 2024 campaign website, and it’s just so cool! The new site, called “<a href="https://www.peoplefor.org/kamalahq-now-headquarters-online-organizing-project-next-generation-campaigning">Headquarters</a>,” is described as an online organizing hub for left-wing Gen Z activists. It’s also a joint venture with the radical far-left outfit People for the American Way. (I have been in combat with them for 30+ years)<br>
 <br>
Every time Harris talks, she sounds like she thinks it’s November 5, 2024, all over again. She still can’t believe that she is not the president of the United States.<br>
 <br>
Here’s a mental exercise: Name one promise or initiative she announced during her 107-day campaign that you or anyone you know is upset about because she lost the election and couldn’t do it. There are none!<br>
 <br>
The chattering class argues that if only Harris had more time, she could have won. She was vice president for four years. She was in the Senate for four years. She told us during the campaign what mattered to her.<br>
 <br>
Harris and her Democrat allies spent $175 million reassuring us that, as president, she would ensure as many of our preborn children as possible were aborted. She was one of the most aggressive advocates of boys becoming girls and radical surgeries on little children. And she was quick to condemn anyone who disagreed as a bigot.<br>
 <br>
She was the Border Czar who didn’t go to the border, except for a brief drive-by <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2024/09/28/border-patrol-union-roasts-kamala-harriss-border-visit-she-was-nowhere-to-be-found/">photo op</a>. She kept saying the border was secure, but I must admit it was hard to hear her over the noise of 20 million illegal foreign nationals entering the country.<br>
 <br>
All joking aside, it is deeply disturbing that Kamala Harris still managed to get 48% of the vote.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>Trump RX</strong><br>
 <br>
Thursday, President Trump announced the formal launch of <a href="https://trumprx.gov/">TrumpRX.gov</a>. TrumpRX will help uninsured people who Democrats correctly say can’t afford high-cost prescription drugs. But while Democrats talk about it, President Trump did something about it.<br>
 <br>
He called the executives of major pharmaceutical companies into the White House. The president told them that the days of gouging Americans while selling their products in other countries at much cheaper prices were over. This is another manifestation of what America First means. In this case, it means Americans being treated fairly.<br>
 <br>
Medications from five major pharmaceutical companies—AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer—are available on TrumpRX now. More companies will be joining the site soon.<br>
 <br>
In addition, the Make America Healthy Again movement, under the extraordinary leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is working to prevent chronic diseases that are making Americans scandalously unhealthy.<br>
 <br>
For example, diabetes alone costs the United States approximately $400 billion a year in medical expenses and lost productivity. Sadly, nearly 20% of American teenagers are prediabetic.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>Left-wing Hate</strong><br>
 <br>
Maryland resident Colin Demarco was arrested last month in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Arlington, Virginia. He had been captured on a Ring camera outside the home of senior Trump administration official <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2026/02/05/maryland-man-charged-with-attempted-murder-of-trump-omb-russell-vought/">Russ Vought</a> wearing gloves, sunglasses, a mask, and a backpack. He was there to kill Vought.<br>
 <br>
When federal agents searched his online accounts, they discovered messages discussing a “stash of weapons,” a “body disposal guide,” and social media posts praising assassin Luigi Mangione and expressing his desire to kill President Trump.<br>
 <br>
Demarco told police that Election Day 2024 was the worst day of his life. He was convinced that Donald Trump would cause a world war and impose a fascist dictatorship on America.<br>
 <br>
In other words, Demarco believed Democrat Party talking points during the 2024 campaign and every day since then. He is in the same category as Ryan Routh, who was just sentenced to life in prison last week for attempting to assassinate President Trump.<br>
 <br>
Routh said he was motivated by the same hate for Trump as was the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kavanaugh-assassination-suspect-portrayed-himself-online-trans-gamer-girl-named-sophie">transgender man</a> who traveled from California to Washington, D.C., to murder conservative Supreme Court justices.<br>
 <br>
Russ Vought and his family are now under 24-hour protection by U.S. Marshals. Many of his colleagues at the White House are also receiving 24-hour protection or have moved onto <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/liberal-outlets-criticize-trump-officials-relocating-military-housing-after-threats-harassment">military bases</a> because of repeated death threats from unhinged leftists.<br>
 <br>
On a personal note, I am reminded to ask you to pray for all the people working in high levels of the administration, including members of my family. They all have targets on their backs “painted” there by the Marxist Left.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<strong>Terrible Teachers</strong><br>
 <br>
Radical schoolteachers are using young kids as political propaganda tools. They are teaching children <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2026/02/04/left-wing-teachers-across-the-country-are-forcing-kids-to-protest-ice/">to oppose</a> federal immigration police and the enforcement of our immigration laws.<br>
 <br>
Many of these children can’t read yet, but these teachers are not interested in that. They see their job as preparing the next generation of leftist demonstrators. That’s all the Marxist <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/chicago-teachers-union-sparks-backlash-with-video-harassing-target-employees-over-ice-as-test-scores-plummet">teachers’ unions</a> are interested in. American flags are turned upside down, and test scores are down, but progressive activism is up!<br>
 <br>
If teachers were instructing students to praise immigration police and respect the law, the cries of “fascist indoctrination” would be deafening.<br>
 <br>
All of these radical left teachers should be fired! Their indoctrination of America’s children is a dangerous violation of norms. Ten years from now, some of these kids will be wearing Antifa “uniforms” and destroying statues of American heroes.<br>
 <br>
The Marxist educational establishment is one of the biggest domestic threats to our Republic. I have seen the leftist rot up close during my time in the Reagan administration as undersecretary of education and in my 2000 presidential campaign.<br>
 <br>
I will never forget one visit to a New Hampshire elementary school during the 2000 GOP primary. After speaking to the young children about American exceptionalism, I got two questions from the kids: Why do I hate gays, and why won’t I let two men who love each other get married?<br>
 <br>
After each child posed their question, they quickly looked over to the teacher to get the nod of approval.<br>
 <br>
By the way, Speaker Mike Johnson was recently pressed by leftist media hacks to explain why Christians support secure borders and immigration enforcement. After answering the question, he posted a more thorough explanation online. I highly recommend taking a few minutes to read his <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/2018777016607060089">excellent analysis</a>.<br>
 <br>

<strong>Trump’s Economy</strong><br>
 <br>
The latest Harvard-Harris <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2026/02/03/voters-feel-better-about-the-economy/">poll</a> asked voters an interesting question. They were given a choice of two visions for the country and asked which one they preferred. </p>

<ul>
    <li>
<span>Option 1: Higher government spending, liberal immigration, more taxes on the wealthy, and larger healthcare subsidies.</span><span> </span>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li><span>Option 2: Reduced government spending, lower taxes, tougher trade deals, lower prescription drug costs, and a closed border.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span> <br>
It wasn’t close—40% of voters chose Option 1, the leftist vision, while 60% chose Option 2, the conservative vision.<br>
 <br>
In recent days, the stock market has been dominated by the spending plans announced by big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft. In 2026, these companies announced that they will invest a total of <a href="https://www.aol.com/finance/big-tech-set-spend-650-163907395.html">$660 billion</a> in capital expenditures. That’s roughly the size of the entire economy of Sweden.<br>

It may not make any difference to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW8Vq6xM-fw&amp;t=14s">Hillary Clinton</a>, but it makes a big difference to the families of the men who died in Benghazi and to millions of patriotic Americans who don’t like seeing our country humiliated.</span><span> </span>
