No further details of the incident were disclosed.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"></span><p>Despite holding no official government post, Saif al-Islam was for years considered one of the most powerful figures in Libya, shaping policy and serving as a key interlocutor with Western governments during his fatherâs four-decade rule.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"></span> <span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"></span> <div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"><div class="k7lcu"><p class="efT4r">Gaddafi Junior Assassinated: Masked Gunmen Storm His Home, Hit Point-Blank &amp; Vanish | Libya Crisis</p></div></div> <span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"></span><p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="13"><h3>The acceptable face of Gaddafi-era Libya</h3></p><p>Educated at the London School of Economics and fluent in English, Saif al-Islam cultivated close ties with Western capitals and was widely seen as a reformist figure within the Libyan system. </p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"></span><p>He played a central role in Libyaâs decision to abandon its weapons of mass destruction programme and negotiated compensation for families of victims of the 1988 Pan Am Flight 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"></span><p>He frequently called for a constitution, political reform and respect for human rights, positioning himself as the figure who could reintegrate Libya into the international community after years of sanctions and isolation.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"></span><p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="23"><h3><keyword id="32773330" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="2011-Uprising" source="keywords">2011 uprising</keyword> and the turn to force</h3></p><p>That image collapsed when the 2011 uprising against Muammar Gaddafi erupted. Saif al-Islam publicly sided with his father and became one of the architects of the regimeâs violent response to the revolt, referring to rebels as âratsâ.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"></span><p>âWe fight here in Libya, we die here in Libya,â he told Reuters at the time. He warned that ârivers of bloodâ would flow and said the government would fight âto the last man and woman and bulletâ.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"></span><p>In a televised address, he cautioned: âAll of Libya will be destroyed.

He was captured by the Abu Bakr al-Sadiq Brigade militia and taken to the western town of Zintan, about a month after his father was killed by rebels.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"></span><p>âIâm staying here. Theyâll empty their guns into me the second I go out there,â he said in comments captured on an audio recording during his capture, according to Reuters. </p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"></span><p>He spent about six years in detention in Zintan. Human Rights Watch said he did not allege physical abuse, though concerns were raised over prolonged solitary confinement. He said he was isolated and did not receive visitors, though he had access to television and books.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"></span><p>In 2015, a Tripoli court sentenced him to death by firing squad for war crimes. The International Criminal Court also issued an arrest warrant against him for âmurder and persecutionâ.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"></span><p class="cdatainfo   id-r-component " data-pos="42"><h3>Return from the shadows and election bid</h3></p><p>Released in 2017 under an amnesty law, Saif al-Islam remained largely underground for years to avoid assassination, according to Libyan analyst Mustafa Fetouri. From 2016, he was allowed limited contact with people inside and outside Libya.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"></span><p>In 2021, wearing traditional Libyan attire, he resurfaced publicly to file his candidacy for Libyaâs planned presidential elections, seeking to draw on nostalgia for stability under his fatherâs rule.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"></span><p>His candidacy proved deeply divisive. He was disqualified due to his conviction, and efforts to appeal were blocked by armed groups. The dispute became a major factor in the collapse of the election process and Libyaâs return to political stalemate.</p><span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"></span><p>âIâve been away from the Libyan people for 10 years,â he told The New York Times Magazine in 2021. âYou need to come back slowly, slowly.
