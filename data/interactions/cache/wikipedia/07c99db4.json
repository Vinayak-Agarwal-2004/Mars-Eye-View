The city is located on the Caspian Sea, covering an area of 468.13 square kilometres (180.75 square miles), with a population of over 623,254 residents, while the urban agglomeration covers over 3,712 square kilometres (1,433 square miles), with a population of roughly 1 million residents. Makhachkala is the fourth-largest city in the Caucasus, the largest city in the North Caucasus and the North Caucasian Federal District, as well as the third-largest city on the Caspian Sea, after Baku and Rasht. The city is extremely ethnically diverse, with a minor ethnic Russian population.\nThe city's historic predecessor is the port town of Anji (Andzhi), which was located in Kumykia, and which was a part of the possessions of the Tarki state, the capital of Kumyks known from the 8th century.\nThe city was named Petrovskoye after Peter the Great. After gaining city status in 1857, the Petrovskoye fortress was renamed Petrovsk-Port. After the Russian Revolution, Petrovsk-Port was renamed Makhachkala on May 14, 1921, after Bolshevik revolutionary Makhach Dakhadaev. On the same day, it became capital of the newly formed Dagestan ASSR. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city became the capital of the Republic of Dagestan.\nMakhachkala is an important economic, educational, scientific, and cultural centre of the North Caucasus. The city is a major Russian seaport on the Caspian Sea, and a transport hub. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in Russia, and is currently going through a construction boom.", "thumbnail": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%2C_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE.jpg/500px-%D0%9C%D0%B0%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0%2C_%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80_%D0%A1%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0_%D0%A1%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE.jpg"}
