{"title": "Butte", "pageid": 337871, "fullurl": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte", "extract": "In geomorphology, a butte ( BEWT) is an isolated hill with steep, often vertical sides and a small, relatively flat top; buttes are smaller landforms than mesas, plateaus, and tablelands. The word butte comes from the French word butte (French: [byt]), meaning 'knoll' (of any size); its use is prevalent in the Western United States, including the Southwest, where mesa (Spanish for 'table') is used for the larger landform.\nDue to their distinctive shapes, buttes are frequently landmarks in plains and mountainous areas. To differentiate the two landforms, geographers use the rule of thumb that a mesa has a top that is wider than its height, while a butte has a top that is narrower than its height.", "thumbnail": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Monument_Valley%2C_late_afternoon.jpg/500px-Monument_Valley%2C_late_afternoon.jpg"}
