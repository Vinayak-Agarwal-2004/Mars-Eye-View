Al-Jamaa al-Islamiya has condemned the act as a violation of Lebanese sovereignty, asserting that it is part of a broader strategy by Israel to intimidate local communities and destabilize the region, especially following recent military actions in southern Lebanon. This incident underscores the fragile nature of the ceasefire and the ongoing geopolitical complexities that characterize Israeli-Lebanese relations.",
